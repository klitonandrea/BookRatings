0,"['Cassie Miles', 'Kay Bergstrom']",,/type/text,"Kay Bergstrom was born on 1947 and grew up in a small town at the very tip of southern Illinois, USA. A tomboy, she spent most of her time outside and got into big trouble for breaking the trellis while climbing out her second-story bedroom window. When her family moved to Los Ángeles, California, major culture shock ensued. She discovered that grapefruits grew on trees, television offered more than two channels, and all the other girls had breasts. While hiding out and waiting for her chest to develop, she read voraciously, raiding her mother's bookshelf for Mickey Spillane when she finished all her Nancy Drew novels. Another move took her family to Denver, Arizona, the place Cassie still calls home.

She graduated from North Central college outside Chicago, got married, and returned to Colorado where she worked in personnel at the Denver Post and lived in a mountain cabin without running water. Upon learning she was pregnant, a return to civilization seemed prudent. She settled in Denver, raised two amazing daughters, and started writing for Harlequin as Cassie Miles. After her divorce, she took a break from romance and wrote straight suspense.

During her frantic years as a single mom, writing books and working odd jobs to supplement her income, she hardly had time to breathe, much less to dream. Then something remarkable happened. She fell in love with a tall, sexy man who was an aerial photographer and the author of tough-guy mystery novels. Fortunately, he loved her back. She found her real-life hero, inherited three more grown kids and three grandchildren. She started writing romance again, loving every minute of a life filled with laughter, crazy road trips, sailboats, and journeys to Oregon with long walks on rocky beaches. Not too long ago, the love of her life developed inoperable pancreatic cancer. With supportive friends and family standing by, he died at home. She has no regrets and considers herself lucky to have found her soul mate, the man with whom she shared a perfect love.

She now lives alone, surrounded by beautiful memories, while writes romances. From the balcony of her high-rise, she has a view of the gold dome of the Colorado State Capitol and the front edge of the Rockies. If she could find a way to add the ocean, she'd have the best of all possible worlds. Recently voted Writer of the Year by Rocky Mountain Fiction Writers, she attends critique groups specialising in mystery and romance, the perfect balance for Harlequin Intrigue books. One of her daughters once described her writing this way, ""Romantic suspense. You know, kiss-kiss, bang-bang."" If only it were that simple...",1947,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL1423453A,/type/datetime,2014-03-10T00:31:24.013856,3.0,,,,Cassie Miles,Cassie Miles,,,3,,,,/type/author,,,1947-04-05 00:00:00,,70.0

**The Library at Night by Alberto Manguel** 
*Reviewed by Peter Ackroyd, The Times   May 8, 2008* 

There is an old superstition that books, alone in the night and the silence, 
whisper one to another; the library then becomes an echo chamber of words 
and syllables, conjuring up the great general drama of the human spirit. 
Libraries are legendary places. Libraries enter myth as well as history. Lost 
libraries, like that of Alexandria, are a reminder of the transience of human 
achievement and of human learning. “No place,” Samuel Jonson said, 
“affords a more striking conviction of the vanity of human hopes than a 
public library.”

From birth, comics played an important role in Schulz’s life. At just two days old, an uncle nicknamed him “Sparky” after the horse Spark Plug from the Barney Google comic strip, and throughout his youth he and his father shared a Sunday morning ritual reading the funnies. Schulz always knew he wanted to be a cartoonist and was very proud when Ripley’s newspaper feature, Believe it or Not, published his drawing of the family dog in 1937.

Schulz put his artistic ambitions on hold during World War II while serving as a machine-gun squad leader, though he regularly sketched episodes of daily army life in his sketchbook. Following his discharge in 1945, Schulz returned to St. Paul to pursue a cartooning career. Between 1947 and 1950, he drew a weekly comic panel for the St. Paul Pioneer Press and also sold seventeen comic gags to The Saturday Evening Post. After many rejection slips, Schulz finally realized his dream of creating a nationally-syndicated daily comic strip when Peanuts debuted in seven newspapers on October 2, 1950. By 1965, Schulz was twice honored with the Reuben Award by the National Cartoonists Society for his talents, and Peanuts was an international success.

When Schulz announced his retirement for health reasons in December 1999, Peanuts was in more than 2,600 newspapers worldwide; he died shortly thereafter, on Saturday, February 12, 2000, just hours before the final Peanuts Sunday strip appeared in newspapers. ([Source][1])

His most famous books, [*Ficciones*][1] (1944) and [*The Aleph*][2] (1949), are compilations of short stories interconnected by common themes: dreams, labyrinths, libraries, fictional writers and works, religion, God. Scholars have noted that Borges's progressive blindness helped him to create innovative literary symbols through imagination since ""poets, like the blind, can see in the dark"". The poems of his late period dialogue with such cultural figures as Spinoza, Luís de Camões, and Virgil. ([Source][3].)

0,,,/type/text,"Iris Johansen was born on April 7, 1938. She worked for a major airline formany years and traveled extensively. After her two children, Tamara andRoy, left home for High School, she decided to devote her newfound free timeto writing. Since she loved reading romance novels, she penned a love story,and found to her surprise that ""I was just as voracious a writer as I was areader."" During the 1980's, her name was emblazoned on dozens of slendervolumes featuring spirited adventuresses, passionate mystery men andsmoldering love scenes. These days, Iris is one of a posse of former romancewriters dominating the *New York Times* bestseller lists: Jayne Ann Krentz,Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Tami Hoag, Sandra Brown and Tess Gerritsen allcame up through the category-romance ranks.

Iris Johansen's writing hobby became a career after she sent her firstromance novel in to Bantam Loveswept. Early on in her career, she developedthe habit of following characters from book to book, sometimes introducingminor characters in one novel who then become major figures in another. Shedeveloped families, relationships and even fictional countries in herromance novels, which ""stretched the boundaries of the standard formulas,""according to Barbara E. Kemp in *Twentieth-Century Romance and HistoricalWriters*. In 1991, she broke out of category romance (a term for short bookswritten to conform to the length, style and subject matter guidelines for apublisher's series) with *The Wind Dancer*, a romantic-suspense novel set in16th-century Italy. She followed it with two sequels, *Storm Winds* and *Reapthe Wind*, to form a trilogy, then wrote several more stand-alone romancenovels before *The Ugly Duckling* was published in 1996. *The UglyDuckling*was her first book to be released in hardcover, and the firsttosignificantly broaden her readership beyond her romance fan base. Sincethen, her plots have gotten tighter and more suspense-driven; critics havepraised her ""flesh-and-blood characters, crackling dialogue and lean,suspenseful plotting"" (*Publishers Weekly*). Some of her most popular booksfeature forensic sculptor Eve Duncan, who first appeared in *The Face ofDeception* in 1998. But she seems equally comfortable with maleprotagonists, and her books have crossed the gender division that oftencharacterizes popular fiction. Indeed, *Publishers Weekly* called *TheSearch* ""that rarity: a woman's novel for men.""

Now, Iris Johansen is a bestselling writer, who has more than twenty millioncopies of her books in print and has won many awards for her achievements inwriting. ""My writing schedule is very disciplined. I try to be up in myoffice by nine every morning and I work until I've completed at least tenpages. Sometimes that takes four or five hours, sometimes ten or twelve. Itdepends on the flow, the research, and the pace at which the characters aremoving the story. There are times when the story is streaking like a bullet.Then I just hang on and stay with it. I do have a research assistant, mydaughter, Tamara. I wouldn't know what to do without her. She's invaluablein finding out both the small details and the big picture, though I do makeher want to pull her hair out in frustration sometimes when I ask her ifthere isn't a way we can make a certain plot point happen. But then shestarts to dig and quite often comes up with a way that can be truthful andfactual and still keep my story humming.""

Iris lives near Atlanta, Georgia, where she is currently at work on a newnovel, while her daughter, Tamara Brooking, serves as her researchassistant. Her son, Roy Johansen, is an Edgar Award-winning screenwriter andnovelist, and they have collaborated in some projects.",7 April 1938,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL19043A,/type/datetime,2013-09-04T09:52:09.451712,6.0,,,,Iris Johansen,Iris Johansen,,[7260676],6,,,,/type/author,,,1938-04-07 00:00:00,,79.0

His works are characterized by deep psychological analysis, a certain sense of paradox and an absurd, anti-nationalist flavor. In 1937 he published his first novel, Ferdydurke, which presented many of his usual themes: the problems of immaturity and youth, the creation of identity in interactions with others, and an ironic, critical examination of class roles in Polish society and culture.

0,"['Fry, Stephen']",,/type/text,"Stephen John Fry (born 24 August 1957) is a British actor, writer, journalist, comedian, television presenter and film director. He first came to attention in the 1982 Cambridge Footlights Revue presentation, ""The Cellar Tapes"", which also included Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson and Tony Slattery. With Hugh Laurie, as the comedy double act Fry and Laurie, he co-wrote and co-starred in A Bit of Fry and Laurie, and the duo also played the title roles in Jeeves and Wooster.

As a solo actor, Fry played the lead in the film Wilde, was Melchett in the Blackadder television series and is the host of the quiz show, QI. He also presented a 2008 television series Stephen Fry in America, which saw him travelling across all 50 U.S. states in six episodes. Fry has become known to American audiences for his recurring guest role as Dr. Gordon Wyatt on the Fox crime series Bones.

Since the publication of his first novel, *The Liar* (1993), Fry has written three additional novels, several non-fiction works and an autobiography. *Making History* (1997) is partly set in an alternative universe where Adolf Hitler's father is made infertile and his replacement proves a rather more effective Führer. The book won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History. *The Hippopotamus* (1994) centers around Edward (Ted/Tedward) Wallace and his stay at his old friend Lord Logan's country manor in Norfolk. *The Stars' Tennis Balls* (2000) is a modern retelling of The Count of Monte Cristo. Fry's book, *The Ode Less Travelled: Unlocking the Poet Within*, is a guide to writing poetry.

In the United Kingdom, he is a well-known narrator of audiobooks, notably the Harry Potter series. He has recorded audio versions of works by Roald Dahl, Michael Bond, A. A. Milne, Anthony Buckeridge and Douglas Adams, as well as several of his own books.

When writing a book review for Tatler, Fry wrote under an alias, Williver Hendry, editor of *A Most Peculiar Friendship: The Correspondence of Lord Alfred Douglas and Jack Dempsey*, a field close to Fry's heart as an Oscar Wilde enthusiast. Once a columnist in The Listener and The Daily Telegraph, he now writes a weekly technology column in the Saturday edition of The Guardian. His blog attracted more than 300,000 visitors in its first two weeks of existence.

On 26 May 2009, Fry unveiled The Dongle of Donald Trefusis, an audiobook series following the character Donald Trefusis (a character from Fry's novel The Liar and from the BBC Radio 4 series Loose Ends), set over 12 episodes. After its release, it reached No. 1 on the UK Album Chart album chart list.

He published his first stories aged 11 in the Robin comic, winning a cricket bat the same year in a children’s writing competition. After graduating from secondary school, he worked as an assistant in the antiquarian department of John Smith's bookshop. At work, he met her future wife, Elizabeth. Published since 1963, he started to wrote suspense novels as Hugh C. Rae, but he also used the pseudonyms of Robert Crawford, R.B. Houston, Stuart Stern (with S. Ungar) and James Albany. On 1973, his novel ""The Shooting Gallery"" was nominee by the Edgar Award. On 1974, he wrote the first few romance novels with Peggie Coghlan, using the popular pseudonym Jessica Stirling. However, when she retired 7 years after the first book was published, he continued writing more than 30 on his own, and also as Caroline Crosby. His female pseudonyms first became widely known in 1999, when ""The Wind from the Hills"" was shortlisted for Romantic Novel of the Year Award by the Romantic Novelists' Association.

His political philosophy influenced the French Revolution and the development of modern political, sociological and educational thought.

His novel, *Emile: or, On Education*, which he considered his most important work, is a seminal treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship. His sentimental novel, Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse, was of great importance to the development of pre-Romanticism and romanticism in fiction. Rousseau's autobiographical writings: his *Confessions*, which initiated the modern autobiography, and his *Reveries of a Solitary Walker* were among the pre-eminent examples of the late 18th-century movement known as the ""Age of Sensibility"", featuring an increasing focus on subjectivity and introspection that has characterized the modern age.

Rousseau also made important contributions to music as a theorist. During the period of the French Revolution, Rousseau was the most popular of the philosophers among members of the Jacobin Club. He was interred as a national hero in the Panthéon in Paris, in 1794, 16 years after his death.<sup>[1][1]</sup>

He held many jobs, until 1945, when he was discharged from the service, and he settled on the banks of the Rhone and tried to live off his painting. But it the birth of his second child forced him back into employement, and he went to work as a book-keeper for Social Security. He stayed there nine years.

He was educated in schools in Maryland and Virginia, but he never graduated from high school. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps when he was seventeen and served in the South Pacific and New Zealand during World War II. He worked briefly as a driver for a newspaper, but after 1950 he was a full-time writer.

Uris published his first novel, *Battle Cry*, when he was 29. He sold the novel to a film producer and wrote the screenplay. He is well-known for his screenplay, *Gunfight at the OK Corral*. His novel, *Exodus*, was an overwhelming success, and as a result he gained international recognition. ([Source][1])

Hubbard's writings became the guiding texts for the *Church of Scientology*  and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation.

Her father, Joseph Burford, was something of an odd-job man, with no steady profession, but he quickly passed on his great love of books to his young daughter. She was an avid reader from the age of four onwards. In her early twenties, she married a leather merchant, George Percival Hibbert, who shared her love of books and reading.

Eleanor Burford was one of the preeminent English authors of historical fiction for most of the twentieth century. She used eight pennames during her career and many of her readers under one penname never suspected her other identities. In 1941, she began signing her novels with her maiden name: Eleanor Burford, later she created her first and most prolific pseudonym: Jean Plaidy. In the 1950's she used the pseudonyms: Elbur Ford, Kathleen Kellow and Ellalice Tate. In 1960, she created the pseudonyms: Anna Percival and the popular Victoria Holt. In 1972, she created her last pseudonym Philippa Carr. (Some of her novels were reedited as different pseudonyms)

She died on January 18, 1993 at sea, somewhere between Greece and Port Said, Egypt. By the time of her death, the novels of Jean Plaidy had sold more than 14 million copies worldwide. Her last novel The Black Opal as Victoria Holt was published posthumously, under this pseudonym, she sold 56 millon copies and as Phillipa Carr, 3 million.",,,01 September 1906,,/type/datetime,2008-10-16T11:53:44.701170,,18 January 1993,,,/authors/OL5460455A,/type/datetime,2016-02-19T15:55:43.587595,13.0,,,,Victoria Holt,Victoria HOLT,,[6878872],13,,,,/type/author,,,1906-09-01 00:00:00,1993-01-18 00:00:00,87.0

In 1900, he married Blanche Wilhelmina Victoria Hawley (1883-1955), the 16 years old daughter of the noted New York scenic artist H. Hughson Hawley; they moved to the United States, where he found work as a scene painter. The marriage had a daughter, Gillian. He returned to England around 1910, and settled in Eastbourne, Sussex.

On 9 August 1952, he died after a long battle with cancer at 73 in Eastbourne.

He published his first romance novel My Lady Caprice in 1907. The success of his early novels led Farnol to become a professional writer.

([Source][1].)

[Comment from Ursula Le Guin on The Guardian][2]:

> You can't write science fiction well if you haven't read it, though not all who try to write it know this. But nor can you write it well if you haven't read anything else. Genre is a rich dialect, in which you can say certain things in a particularly satisfying way, but if it gives up connection with the general literary language it becomes a jargon, meaningful only to an ingroup. Useful models may be found quite outside the genre. I learned a lot from reading the ever-subversive Virginia Woolf.

> I was 17 when I read [Orlando][3]. It was half-revelation, half-confusion to me at that age, but one thing was clear: that she imagined a society vastly different from our own, an exotic world, and brought it dramatically alive. I'm thinking of the Elizabethan scenes, the winter when the Thames froze over. Reading, I was there, saw the bonfires blazing in the ice, felt the marvellous strangeness of that moment 500 years ago – the authentic thrill of being taken absolutely elsewhere.

> How did she do it? By precise, specific descriptive details, not heaped up and not explained: a vivid, telling imagery, highly selected, encouraging the reader's imagination to fill out the picture and see it luminous, complete.

> In [Flush][4], Woolf gets inside a dog's mind, that is, a non-human brain, an alien mentality – very science-fictional if you look at it that way. Again what I learned was the power of accurate, vivid, highly selected detail. I imagine Woolf looking down at the dog asleep beside the ratty armchair she wrote in and thinking what are your dreams? and listening . . . sniffing the wind . . . after the rabbit, out on the hills, in the dog's timeless world.

> Useful stuff, for those who like to see through eyes other than our own.

In 1949 he went to King's College, Cambridge to study medicine, but he began writing fiction and abandoned medicine in 1952 to pursue writing.

Emerson', 'RALPH WALDO EMERSON', 'Ralph Waldo ( Emerson']",,/type/text,"Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American philosopher, essayist, and poet, best remembered for leading the Transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century. His teachings directly influenced the growing New Thought movement of the mid-1800s. He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society.

Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of Transcendentalism in his 1836 essay, Nature. As a result of this ground-breaking work he gave a speech entitled The American Scholar in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. considered to be America's ""Intellectual Declaration of Independence"". Considered one of the great orators of the time, Emerson's enthusiasm and respect for his audience enraptured crowds. His support for abolitionism late in life created controversy, and at times he was subject to abuse from crowds while speaking on the topic. When asked to sum up his work, he said his central doctrine was ""the infinitude of the private man.""

0,['Edgar WALLACE'],,/type/text,"Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace was an English crime writer, journalist, novelist, screenwriter, and playwright, who wrote 175 novels, 24 plays, and numerous articles in newspapers and journals.

Over 160 films have been made of his novels, more than any other author. In the 1920s, one of Wallace's publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read in England were written by him. He is most famous today as the co-creator of King Kong, writing the early screenplay and story for the movie, as well as a short story ""King Kong"" (1933) credited to him and Draycott Dell. He was known for the J. G. Reeder detective stories, The Four Just Men, The Ringer, and for creating the Green Archer character during his lifetime.<sup>[1][1]</sup>

Farmer is best known for his sequences of novel — especially the World of Tiers (1965–93) and Riverworld (1971–83) series. He is noted for the pioneering use of sexual and religious themes in his work, his fascination for — and reworking of — the lore of celebrated pulp heroes, and occasional tongue-in-cheek pseudonymous works written as if by fictional characters.

Philip José Farmer is also well known for remixing classic fictional characters, worlds, and both real and fake authors. This is epitomized with his Wold Newton family group of books that tie all classic fictional characters together as real people and blood relatives resulting from an alien conspiracy; his works such as The Other Log of Phileas Fogg and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life make Farmer the ultimate grandfather of the modern literary mashup. - Wikipedia",26 January 1918,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,25 February 2009,,,/authors/OL220398A,/type/datetime,2016-07-08T06:17:58.328216,9.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'http://www.philipjosefarmer.tk/', 'title': 'Philip José Farmer International Bibliography'}]",,,Philip José Farmer,Philip José Farmer,,[6390598],9,,,,/type/author,,,1918-01-26 00:00:00,2009-02-25 00:00:00,91.0

[Comment from Kelly Link on The Guardian][1]:

> I can't pick just one book by Diana Wynne Jones. She wrote so many books, all of them essential, and funny, and weird, and true. She mixed up fantasy and science fiction and the domestic so that unhappy families and awkward adolescents got smooshed up, quite believably, with mythological figures, extraterrestrial powers, and all other sorts of dangerous beasties. I was already a science-fiction reader before I found [Dogsbody][2]. But I might have outgrown science fiction quickly, moved on to books about horses and girls and high schools, if it weren't for books such as Dogsbody and [The Homeward Bounders][3] and [Archer's Goon][4], and if it weren't for characters such as Kathleen, who rescues a puppy and falls in love with a star, and Jamie, who spies on a dangerous game that They are playing, and Howard, with his two very complicated families.

> Wynne Jones's books are often literally about other worlds, but her characters belong very firmly to this one. They are eccentric, flamboyant, pragmatic, lonely, sometimes selfish, often stubborn, always recognisable. How they navigate the territory that they find themselves in is, I suppose, a kind of metaphor for the process of growing up. But I'm grown up now, and have a child of my own, and I rely on her books, her pinprick insights into familial relationships, her astonishing way of seeing the worlds.

0,"['James Colton', 'James Coulton', 'Rose Brock']",,/type/text,"Joseph Hansen was an American crime writer and poet. Although he published almost forty books in a wide variety of genres, Hansen is best remembered for his ground breaking series of crime novels starring his most iconic creation, Dave Brandstetter, an openly homosexual private eye who still embodied the tough, no-nonsense personality of the classic hardboiled protagonist. His first adventure, *Fadeout*, was published in 1970, and over the next twenty-one years eleven more entries in the series were written.

Hansen published his first work, a poem, in *The New Yorker*, in 1952. He also published poetry in other magazines, briefly sang with a folk-music-group on a California radio-station, and had several part-time jobs in bookstores and magazines.

At the beginning of his career as a novelist, Hansen wrote under the pseudonym James Colton or James Coulton, producing novels such as Strange Marriage and Known Homosexual. He also wrote two gothic novels under the pseudonym Rose Brock.

Hansen was also noted for writing poems, teaching workshops, and hosting a 1960s radio-show called Homosexuality Today. In 1970, he helped to found the first Gay Pride Parade in Hollywood. Hansen disliked the term ""gay"" and always described himself as ""homosexual"".<sup>1</sup>

0,,"Annette Broadrick was born on 26 November 1940. Her mother read to her until she read to herself. From that time on, books became her closest companions and teachers. She was an only child until the middle of her 16th year when her sister Derralee was born. She married immediately after high school graduation in the middle of her 18th year. Twelve months later she had her first son. She ended up having four sons in seven years. People with children do not need to explain what their life was like for the next 20 years. Those people without children do not want to hear about it.

Early on, Annette became a secretary to supplement the family income. Eventually she became a legal secretary and for 25 years she worked for attorneys in Arizona, Texas, Illinois, and Oregon. Her love of books followed her throughout her career as a mother and a secretary. By the time her youngest son graduated from high school she decided to write a book of her own. 

After writing in a spiral notebook for six months, she rented a typewriter and rewrote the book, showed it to a creative writing teacher, who was also a friend, listened to her critique and rewrote her story. Next she showed it to another avid romance reader and carefully listened to her critique. She rewrote her story once again. Next she mailed the manuscript to the Silhouette office in New York. Two months later she received a phone call asking if she’d be willing to do extensive revisions, including cutting one hundred pages. She said yes. This was in January 1984. By the time the book, Circumstantial Evidence, came out in November of that year, she had sold a total of six books.

Since October 1984 Annette has supported herself with her writing. Her career as a published author has also supported her reading habit and in the past five years she has managed to establish a quiet life in the Hill Country of central Texas that soothes as well as stimulates her. She has completed her 50st novel and is currently working on her next novels, she hopes to continue writing the kind of books that readers enjoy. She lives in the soothing Hill Country of central Texas.",,,26 November 1938/1940,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL756065A,/type/datetime,2016-04-18T08:50:07.259042,5.0,,,,Annette Broadrick,Annette Broadrick,,[6962055],5,,,,/type/author,,,1938-04-05 00:00:00,,79.0

After graduating with honors from Yale in 1959, he worked for Hallmark Cards and was a contributing editor for Harper’s and Playboy magazines. He is the author of more than fifty articles, and ten books, including Looking for America: A Writer’s Odyssey (1979); Making Love: An Erotic Odyssey (1993); Voyage of Rediscovery: A Cultural Odyssey Through Polynesia (1995); How to Write: Advice and Reflections (1996); the acclaimed The Making of the Atomic Bomb (1987), which won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award; Deadly Feasts: Tracking the Secrets of a Terrifying New Plague (1997); and Masters of Death: The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust (2002). Rhodes’s ability to cut through to the essentials and follow an action from its onset to its completion is clearly seen in ""Watching the Animals"" (1970), an absorbing and realistic account of the processing of pigs into foodstuffs by the I-D Packing Company of Des Moines, Iowa.

He was a key philosopher of the 20th-century and his most famous work is the novel *L'Étranger* (*The Stranger*).

In 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons within the Revolutionary Union Movement, which was a group opposed to some tendencies of the surrealistic movement of André Breton. Camus was the second-youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature - after Rudyard Kipling - when he became the first African-born writer to receive the award. He is the shortest-lived of any literature laureate to date, having died in an automobile accident just over two years after receiving the award.

He is often cited as a proponent of existentialism, the philosophy that he was associated with during his own lifetime, but Camus himself rejected this particular label. In an interview in 1945, Camus rejected any ideological associations: ""No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked...""",,,7 November 1913,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,4 January 1960,,,/authors/OL124171A,/type/datetime,2014-05-07T01:03:58.681452,14.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus', 'title': 'Wikipedia'}]",,,Albert Camus,Albert Camus,,"[7236307, 6388136, 3367735]",14,,,,/type/author,,,1913-11-07 00:00:00,1960-01-04 00:00:00,47.0

In France, Hugo's literary fame comes first from his poetry but also rests upon his novels and his dramatic achievements. Among many volumes of poetry, Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles stand particularly high in critical esteem, and Hugo is sometimes identified as the greatest French poet. Outside France, his best-known works are the novels Les Misérables and Notre-Dame de Paris (known in English also as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame).

Though a committed conservative royalist when he was young, Hugo grew more liberal as the decades passed; he became a passionate supporter of republicanism, and his work touches upon most of the political and social issues and artistic trends of his time. He is buried in the Panthéon.

He served as a hospital corpsman (medic), first with the Naval Air Corps, and then with the Fifth Marines.  After the war, he travelled in England, Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean before returning the the U.S. to resume his education.  He continued his education at several schools, but never earned a degree.  In 1950 he returned to the U.S. to study at an agricultural school, then went to Israel to become a shepherd.  He returned to New York City shortly after and began his writing career as a Talmudic scholar, publishing short stories and several essays in Orthodox Jewish Life beginning in 1949 and in Commentary beginning in 1952, under the name A. A. Davidson.  He was very active in the Orthodox Jewish community in New York City during this period.  His first published science fiction story, ""My Boy Friend's Name is Jello,"" appeared in Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1954.  In 1961 he met Grania Kaiman, and they were married in early 1962, and had a son in November 1962.  He became editor of Fantasy & Science Fiction from 1962-1965.  In 1963 he and his family moved to Milford, Pennsylvania, but had several disagreements with their landlord which resulted in them being evicted, so they moved to Amecameca, Mexico.  In June 1964, Grania moved back to California, while Avram stayed in Mexico with their son.  In 1965, he relocated to British Honduras (now Belize), then to California in 1970, where he began to study and then converted to Tenrikyo, a panentheist Japanese New Religion.  In 1971 he moved to Sausalito, California, close to San Francisco.  In his later years, he lived in Bremerton, Washington, where he died in 1993, aged 70.

Over the course of his writing career, he wrote 20 novels and collaborated on several more, but he was best known for his short science fiction stories.  He was recognized with a Hugo Award, a World Fantasy Award (including the prestigious Life Achievement Award), and an Edgar Award.  He was survived by his his ex-wife Grania Davis, who continues to edit and release his unpublished works.",23 April 1923,,,,,8 May 1993,,Avram James Davidson,/authors/OL227499A,/type/datetime,2010-04-12T12:32:30.671539,4.0,,,,Avram Davidson,Avram Davidson,,[5541120],4,,,,/type/author,http://www.avramdavidson.org/,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avram_Davidson,1923-04-23 00:00:00,1993-05-08 00:00:00,70.0

Lerium Tremaine']","Ray Bradbury is one of those rare individuals whose writing has changed the way people think. His more than five hundred published works -- short stories, novels, plays, screenplays, television scripts, and verse -- exemplify the American imagination at its most creative. 

Once read, his words are never forgotten. His best-known and most beloved books, *The Martian Chronicles*, *The Illustrated Man*, *Fahrenheit 451* and *Something Wicked This Way Comes*, are masterworks that readers carry with them over a lifetime. His timeless, constant appeal to audiences young and old has proven him to be one of the truly classic authors of the 20th Century -- and the 21st. 

In recognition of his stature in the world of literature and the impact he has had on so many for so many years, Bradbury was awarded the National Book Foundation's 2000 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, an the National Medal of Arts in 2004.

His first published SF story, ""Black Destroyer"" was published in 1939, and is considered to be one of the first works of the Golden Age of science fiction. In 1941 he left his job at the Department of National Defence to become a full-time writer, and he went on to write a large number of short stories. In 1944 he moved to Hollywood, California. In the 1950s he briefly became involved in L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics projects. Although he left Dianetics, he claimed that Hubbard's followers continued to harass him, and he stopped writing for a few years. In the 1960s Frederik Pohl convinced him to start writing again, and he wrote novels (as opposed to short stories that were later developed into novels) until his death in 2000.",,,26 April 1912,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,26 January 2000,,Alfred Elton van Vogt,/authors/OL24708A,/type/datetime,2014-05-28T11:36:44.299058,9.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/', 'title': 'Sevagram'}]","Los Angeles, CA",,A.

0,['Christopher Brennan'],,/type/text,"Christopher John Brennan (1870-1932) born in Sydney of Irish parents, was educated at various Catholic schools, including St. Ignatius (riverview) College, and at the University of Sydney, where he specialized in classics and philosophy. A travelling scholarship enabled him to continue his studies for two years (1892-94) in Berlin, where he met his future wife.

During the major part of the first quarter of the 20th century he lectured in the University of Sydney, first as an assistant on the French and German staffs, then (from the end of 1921) as Associate-Professor of German and Comparative Literature.

Estranged from his wife, involved in a tragical love affair, and having lost his University post in 1925, he endured several years of hardship and unspeakable distress that undermined his health. But his last few years were more serene, if not positively happy, and were marked by a return to the faith of his fathers. He died of stomach cancer, and was buried according to the rites of his Church at the Gore Hill cemetary (Sydney).

His works include novels, short stories, plays, and political tracts; in his lifetime some were published under his own name, while others appeared anonymously and Sade denied being their author. He is best known for his erotic novels, which combined philosophical discourse with pornography, depicting bizarre sexual fantasies with an emphasis on violence, criminality, and blasphemy against the Catholic Church. He was a proponent of extreme freedom, unrestrained by morality, religion or law.

Sade was incarcerated in various prisons and in an insane asylum for about 32 years of his life; eleven years in Paris (10 of which were spent in the Bastille) a month in Conciergerie, two years in a fortress, a year in Madelonnettes, three years in Bicêtre, a year in Sainte-Pélagie, and 13 years in the Charenton asylum. Many of his works were written in prison. The term ""sadism"" is derived from his name.

Her father died when she was eleven years old. Her mother taught her at home, encouraging her to write at a very young age. At the age of 16, she went to Mrs. Dryden's finishing school in Paris to study singing and piano. In 1914, at age 24, she married Colonel Archibald Christie, an aviator in the Royal Flying Corps. While he went away to war, she worked as a nurse and wrote her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920), which wasn't published until four years later. When her husband came back from the war, they had a daughter. In 1928 she divorced her husband, who had been having an affair. In 1930, she married Sir Max Mallowan, an archaeologist and a Catholic. She was happy in the early years of her second marriage, and did not divorce her husband despite his many affairs. She travelled with her husband's job, and set several of her novels set in the Middle East. Most of her other novels were set in a fictionalized Devon, where she was born.

Agatha Christie is credited with developing the ""cozy style"" of mystery, which became popular in, and ultimately defined, the Golden Age of fiction in England in the 1920s and '30s, an age of which she is considered to have been Queen. In all, she wrote over 66 novels, numerous short stories and screenplays, and a series of romantic novels using the pen name Mary Westmacott. She was the single most popular mystery writer of all time.

0,"['Stone Katherine', 'Katherine Stone Chase']","Seattle-born author Katherine Stone set about plotting her life’s journey at a very young age.  At age five she knew she hoped to become a doctor. Then, after writing her first short story at age 11, she realized that she’d love to be a writer, too.
   
In pursuit of that youthful dream, Katherine attended Stanford University, where she completed her premed requirements while majoring in English.  She received her M.D. from the University of Washington. Following her internal medicine residency in San Francisco, she accepted a fellowship in infectious diseases in Los Angeles.
   
What remains one of the world’s largest outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease coincided with her fellowship, which gave her the opportunity to write and lecture on this mysterious new disease. But it was not all work and no play.  There was also romance in L.A.  It was there (during a spinal tap!) that she met her future husband, physician and novelist Jack Chase.
   
While she had accomplished the first half of her young-life goals, Katherine never really got around to the second part—being a writer—until Jack bought her a word processor and urged her to “Just do it.”  The result? Bestselling books in the distinctive Katherine Stone style:  a marriage of lyrical prose, evocative emotion and, above all, romance.
   
“There’s nothing wrong with incurable romanticism,” the physician asserts.  “I love writing about nice people, who are giving life their best shot despite the sometimes monumental obstacles I place in their paths and who discover, despite those obstacles, the splendor and power of love.” 
   
Although Katherine has hung up her stethoscope for the moment and is writing full-time at her home near Seattle, her medical background is often evident in her books.  “I very much enjoy sharing my passion for medicine—its drama, its emotion and yes, its science—with my readers.”",,,1949,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL20697A,/type/datetime,2013-06-30T18:00:56.856412,7.0,,,,Katherine Stone,Katherine Stone,,[7258798],7,,,,/type/author,,,1949-04-05 00:00:00,,68.0

0,"['Bond, Michael.', 'MICHAEL BOND']",,/type/text,"Michael Bond, OBE, (born in Newbury, Berkshire) is an English author, most celebrated for his Paddington Bear series of books.

Bond began writing in 1945 and sold his first short story to the magazine London Opinion. In 1958, after producing a number of plays and short stories and while working as a BBC television cameraman (where he worked filming Blue Peter for a time), his first book, *A Bear Called Paddington*, was published. This was the start of Bond's most famous series of books, telling tales of a bear from ""Darkest Peru"", whose Aunt Lucy sends him to England, carrying a jar of marmalade. The Brown family found the bear at Paddington Station, and adopted him, naming the bear after the station. By 1967, Bond was able to give up his BBC job to work full-time as a writer. Paddington's adventures have been published in nearly twenty countries, and has inspired pop bands, race horses, plays, hot air balloons and a TV series. Bond stated in December 2007 that he did not plan to continue the adventures of Paddington Bear in further volumes.

His first plays were written later than those of Aeschylus, and earlier than those of Euripides. According to the Suda, a 10th century encyclopedia, Sophocles wrote 120 or more plays during the course of his life, but only seven have survived in a complete form, namely Ajax, Antigone, Trachinian Women, Oedipus the King, Electra, Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus. For almost 50 years, Sophocles was the most-awarded playwright in the dramatic competitions of ancient Athens that took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. Sophocles competed in around thirty drama competitions; he won perhaps twenty four and never received lower than second place. Aeschylus won fourteen competitions and was defeated by Sophocles at times.

0,"['Betty A. Neels', 'BETTY NEELS', 'Betty NEELS']",,/type/text,"Betty Neels was born on September 15, 1910 in Devon to a family with firm roots in the civil service. She said she had a blissfully happy childhood and teenage years, which stood her in good stead for the tribulations to come with the Second World War. She was sent away to boarding school, and then went on to train as a nurse, gaining her SRN and SCM, that is, State Registered Nurse and State Certificate of Midwifery.

In 1939 she was called up to the Territorial Army Nursing Service, which later became the Queen Alexandra Reserves, and was sent to France with the Casualty Clearing Station. This comprised eight nursing sisters, including Betty, to 100 men! In other circumstances, she thought that might have been quite thrilling! When France was invaded in 1940, all the nursing sisters managed to escape in the charge of an army major, undertaking a lengthy and terrifying journey to Boulogne in an ambulance. They were incredibly fortunate to be put on the last hospital ship to be leaving the port of Boulogne. But Betty's war didn't end there, for she was posted to Scotland, and then on to Northern Ireland, where she met her Dutch husband. He was a seaman aboard a minesweeper, which was bombed. He survived and was sent to the south of Holland to guard the sluices. However, when they had to abandon their post, they were told to escape if they could, and along with a small number of other men, he marched into Belgium. They stole a ship and managed to get it across the Channel to Dover before being transferred to the Atlantic run on the convoys. Sadly he became ill, and that was when he was transferred to hospital in Northern Ireland, where he met Betty. They eventually married, and were blessed with a daughter. They were posted to London, but were bombed out. As with most of the population, they made the best of things.

When the war finally ended, she and her husband were repatriated to Holland. As his family had believed he had died when his ship went down, this was a very emotional homecoming. The small family lived in Holland for 13 years, and Betty resumed her nursing career there. When they decided to return to England, Betty continued her nursing and when she eventually retired she had reached the position of night superintendent.

Betty Neels began writing almost by accident. She had retired from nursing, but her inquiring mind had no intention of vegetating, and her new career was born when she heard a lady in her local library bemoaning the lack of good romance novels. There was little in Betty's background to suggest that she might eventually become a much-loved novelist.

Her first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam, was published in 1969, and by dint of often writing four books a year, she eventually completed 134 books. She was always quite firm upon the point that the Dutch doctors who frequently appeared in her stories were *not* based upon her husband, but rather upon an amalgam of several of the doctors she met while nursing in Holland.

To her millions of fans around the world, Betty Neels epitomized romance. She was always amazed and touched that her books were so widely appreciated. She never sought plaudits and remained a very private person, but it made her very happy to know that she brought such pleasure to so many readers, while herself gaining a quiet joy from spinning her stories. It is perhaps a reflection of her upbringing in an earlier time that the men and women who peopled her stories have a kindliness and good manners, coupled to honesty and integrity, that is not always present in our modern world. Her myriad of fans found a warmth and a reassurance of a better world in her stories, along with characters who touched the heart, which is all and more than one could ask of a romance writer. She received a great deal of fan mail, and there was always a comment upon the fascinating places she visited in her stories. Quite often those of her fans fortunate enough to visit Holland did use her information as an itinerary for their travels!

After school, he worked as a weaver's apprentice and as a tailor's assistant. At 14, he moved to Copenhagen to be an actor, and was accepted into the Royal Danish Theatre. His career ended when his voice changed, and he decided to become a writer. He published his first story, The Ghost at Palnatoke's Grave, in 1822. An acquaintance paid all expenses to send him to grammar school in Slagelse. He also attended school at Elsinore until 1827. He later admitted that his school years were the darkest and bitterest of his life.

After school, Andersen resumed writing. In 1829, he started to see his first successes, publishing a short story, ""A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager"", and a collection of poems. In 1833 he received a traveling grant from the King and set out to travel through Europe. He published his first novel, The Improvisatore, in 1835. He also published the first set of Fairy Tales, following up with more stories in 1836 and 1837. Although they were not initially successful, they have become his best-known works. He wrote a well-received poem, Jeg er en Skandinav, which celebrated Scandinavism, in 1839.

In 1857, following a visit to Charles Dickens in England, Andersen met Danish actor Lauritz Eckardt and Danish ballet dancer Harald Scharff in Paris. In 1860, he met them again in Bavaria, and the three of them spent a week in Munich together. Anderson fell in love with Scharff, and started corresponding with him when Scharff and Eckardt left Munich. They were united when Andersen returned to Copenhagen in 1862. Their affair lasted for over a year before it was ended by Scharff, and Andersen did not have another serious relationship.

In 1872, Andersen was injured in a fall, and he died of his injuries in 1875.",2 April 1805,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,4 August 1875,Person,,/authors/OL25931A,/type/datetime,2014-07-16T15:42:42.148982,13.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'http://runeberg.org/authors/andersen.html', 'title': 'Project Runeberg'}]",Copenhagen,,Hans Christian Andersen,Hans Christian Andersen,,"[6094090, 5547166]",13,,,Hans Christian.,/type/author,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen,1805-04-02 00:00:00,1875-08-04 00:00:00,70.0

Hull', 'Edith Maude Henderson Winstanley Hull', 'Edith Maude Henderson']","Edith Maude Henderson was born on 16 August 1880 in the Borough of Hampstead, London, England, UK, the daughter of Katie Thorne, of New Brunswick, Canada and James Henderson, a shipowner from Liverpool. As a child she traveled widely with her parents, even visiting Algeria—the setting of her novels. In 1899, she married Percy Winstanley Hull (b. 1869) in London and the couple moved to Derbyshire in the early 1900s. They had a daughter Cecil Winstanley Hull, who also wrote a book Six Weeks in Algeria (1930).

She dabbled writing fiction in the late 1910s while her husband was away serving in World War I. The Sheik, her first effort, was first published in England in 1919 and quickly became an international blockbuster, placing among Publishers Weekly's top ten best sellers for both of the years 1921 and 1922. Hull's volume quickly sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide. Sales further increased when Paramount released a film version of The Sheik in 1921, which launched Rudolph Valentino into cinema immortality as the greatest ""lover"" of the silent screen.

0,"['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien', 'J. R. R. Tolkein', 'J.R.R. Tolkein']",,/type/text,"John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973) was a major scholar of the English language, specialising in Old and Middle English. Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at the University of Oxford, he also wrote a number of stories, including most famously The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of the world which he called by the Middle English name of Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. He has regularly been condemned by the Eng. Lit. establishment, with honourable exceptions, but loved by literally millions of readers worldwide.

In the 1960s he was taken up by many members of the nascent ""counter-culture"" largely because of his concern with environmental issues. In 1997 he came top of three British polls, organised respectively by Channel 4 / Waterstone's, the Folio Society, and SFX, the UK's leading science fiction media magazine, amongst discerning readers asked to vote for the greatest book of the 20th century. 

([Source][1])

**Early Life** 
John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein, South Africa, to English parents. At the age of three his mother brought him and his younger brother, Hilary, back to England. Tolkien's father died soon afterwards in South Africa, so the family stayed in England and by the summer of 1896 his mother found them a home in the hamlet of Sarehole, just outside the city Birmingham. 

Tolkien's family lived in genteel poverty, eventually moving to Moseley a suburb of Birmingham, just north west of Sarehole. When he was 12, Tolkien's mother died, and he and his brother were made wards of a Catholic priest. They lived with aunts and in boarding homes thereafter. The dichotomy between Tolkien's happier days in the rural landscape of Sarehole and his adolescent years in the industrial centre of Birmingham would be felt strongly in his later works. 

**Education** 
The young Tolkien attended King Edward's School in Birmingham in the years 1910 and 1911, where he excelled in classical and modern languages. There are six known contributions he made in the King Edward's School Chronicle. In 1911 he went to Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied Classics, Old English, Germanic languages, Welsh, and Finnish. He quickly demonstrated an aptitude for philology and began to create his own languages. In 1913 Tolkien published his very first poem, called 'From the many-willow'd margin of the immemorial Thames', in the Stapeldon Magazine of Exeter college. 

**The Great War** 
By the time Tolkien had completed his degree at Oxford in 1915, World War I had erupted across Europe. Tolkien enlisted and was commissioned in the Lancashire Fusiliers, but he did not see active duty for months. In this period he wrote the poem 'Goblin Feet' which got published in 'Oxford Poetry 1915'. When he learned that he would be shipped out in March 1916, he married his longtime friend Edith Bratt, the girl the poem was written for. 

Tolkien was sent to the Western Front and fought in the Somme offensive. Almost all of his closest friends were killed. After four months in and out of the trenches, he contracted a typhus-like infection and was sent back to England, where he served for the rest of the war. 

**Academic Career** 
Tolkien's first job was as a lexicographer on the New English Dictionary (helping to draft the Oxford English Dictionary). Tolkien wrote 'A Middle English Vocabulary', but it was not published until 1922, but after it was published some copies were bound with 1st impressions of Sisam’s book, 'Fourteenth Century Verse and Prose' which was published one year before. During this time he began serious work on creating languages that he imagined had been spoken by elves. The languages were based primarily on Finnish and Welsh. He also began his ""Lost Tales"" a mythic history of men, elves, and other creatures he created to provide context for his ""Elvish"" languages. He made the first public presentation of his tales when he read ""The Fall of Gondolin"" to an appreciative audience at the Exeter College Essay Club.

Tolkien then became a professor in English Language at the University of Leeds, where he collaborated with E. V. Gordon on the famous edition of 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'. Tolkien remained at Leeds until 1925, when he took a position teaching Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. In Leeds Tolkien found the time to make a lot of contributions on various Magazines and books like, Gryphon Magazine, Microcosm, TLS, Yorkshire Poetry, Leeds University Verse, e.o.

**Tolkien at Oxford** 
Tolkien spent the rest of his career at Oxford, retiring in 1959. Although he produced little by today's ""publish or perish"" standards, his scholarly writings were of the highest caliber. One of his most influential works is his lecture ""Beowulf, the Monsters and the Critics."" 

At Oxford Tolkien became a founding member of a loose group of like-minded Oxford friends ""The Inklings"" who met for conversation, drinks, and readings from their works-in-progress. Another prominent member was C. S. Lewis, who became one of Tolkien's closest friends. 

Tolkien, a devout Catholic, and Lewis, an agnostic at the time, frequently debated religion and the role of mythology. Unlike Lewis, who tended to dismiss myths and fairy tales, Tolkien firmly believed that they have moral and spiritual value. Said Tolkien, ""The imagined beings have their inside on the outside; they are visible souls. And Man as a whole, Man pitted against the Universe, have we seen him at all till we see that he is like a hero in a fairy tale?"" 

**""In a hole in the ground . . .""** 
It was also during his years at Oxford that Tolkien would scribble an inexplicable note in a student's exam book: ""In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit."" Curious as to what exactly a ""Hobbit"" was and why it should live in a hole, he began to build a story about a short creature who inhabited a world called Middle-earth. This grew into a story he told his children, and in 1936 a version of it came to the attention of the publishing firm of George Allen and Unwin (now part of HarperCollins), who published it as The Hobbit, or There and Back Again, in 1937. It become an instant and enduring classic. 

**Lord of the Rings** 
Stanley Unwin, the publisher, was stunned by The Hobbit's success and asked for a sequel, which blossomed into a multivolume epic. While The Hobbit hinted at the history of Middle-earth that Tolkien had created in his ""Lost Tales"" (which he was now calling ""The Silmarillion""), the sequel drew heavily upon it. So determined was Tolkien to get every detail right that it took him more than a decade to complete the 12-book ""Lord of the Rings."" He often left off writing the story for months to hash out a linguistic problem or historical inconsistency. 

The Lord of the Rings appeared in 1954-1955 in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. While the book was eagerly received by the reading public, critical reviews were everything but neutral. Some critics, such as Philip Toynbee, deplored its fantasy setting, archaic language, and utter earnestness. Others, notably W. H. Auden and C. S. Lewis, lauded it for its straightforward narrative, imagination, and Tolkien's palpable love of language. 

The Lord of the Rings did not reach the height of its popularity until it finally appeared in paperback. Tolkien disliked paperbacks and hadn't authorized a paperback edition. In 1965, however, Ace Books exploited a legal loophole and published an unauthorized paperback version of The Lord of the Rings. Within months Ballantine published an official version (with a rather cross note about respecting an author's wishes). The lower cost of paperbacks and the publicity generated by the copyright dispute boosted sales of the books considerably, especially in America where it was quickly embraced by the 60s counterculture. 

Nearly 50 years after its publication, Tolkien's epic tale has sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into more than 25 languages. 

**Tolkien's Legacy** 
The Lord of the Rings is a singular, contradictory work. Written in an almost archaic form, packed with strange words and obsure historical details, and lacking the modern emphasis on the ""inner life,"" it is unabashedly antimodern. But at the same time its melancholy environmentalism and fully realized alternative world are very modern. It has often been read, among as other things, as an allegory of World War II or the Cold War, but Tolkien himself denied any such interpretation, maintaining it was simply a story to be taken on its own terms.

Its enduring appeal, however, lies not in its literary oddness or straightforward action, but in its beautifully realized world and themes of loss, self-sacrifice, and friendship. In its wake, Tolkien's work left not only a host of sword-and-sorcery imitators and devoted fans, but a lasting legacy in the hundreds of virtual worlds that have come to life in books and films since. 

**Middle-earth after J.R.R**. 
J.R.R. Tolkien died on September 2, 1973. His death did not mark the end of Middle-earth for readers, though. After Tolkien's death his son Christopher endeavored to complete his father's life work. He edited The Silmarillion and saw it published in 1977. In 1980 he began to publish the rest of his father's incomplete writings, culminating in the 12-volume History of Middle-earth series.

0,,,/type/text,"Thomas Merton (January 31, 1915 – December 10, 1968) was a 20th century American Catholic writer. A Trappist monk of the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, he was a poet, social activist and student of comparative religion. In 1949, he was ordained to the priesthood and given the name Father Louis.

Merton wrote more than 70 books, mostly on spirituality, social justice and a quiet pacifism, as well as scores of essays and reviews, including his best-selling autobiography, The Seven Storey Mountain (1948), which sent scores of disillusioned World War II veterans, students, and even teen-agers flocking to monasteries across US, and was also featured in National Review's list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century.

Merton was a keen proponent of interfaith understanding. He pioneered dialogue with prominent Asian spiritual figures, including the Dalai Lama, D.T. Suzuki, the Japanese writer on the Zen tradition, and the Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh. Merton has also been the subject of several biographies.",1915,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,1968,,,/authors/OL26986A,/type/datetime,2010-10-29T11:55:29.084217,5.0,,,,Thomas Merton,Thomas Merton,,[6657673],5,,,,/type/author,,,1915-04-05 00:00:00,1968-04-05 00:00:00,53.0

0,['Yukio mishima'],,/type/text,"Yukio Mishima (三島 由紀夫) was the pen name of Kimitake Hiraoka (平岡 公威), a Japanese author, poet and playwright, also remembered for his ritual suicide by seppuku.

At age six, Mishima enrolled in elite Peers School (Gakushuin 学習院). At 12, Mishima began to write his first stories. He read voraciously the works of Oscar Wilde, Rainer Maria Rilke and numerous classic Japanese authors. After six years at school, he became the youngest member of the editorial board in its literary society. Mishima was attracted to the works of Tachihara Michizō, which in turn created an appreciation for the classical form of the waka. Mishima's first published works included waka poetry, before he turned his attention to prose.

Burroughs', 'Edgar R Burroughs', 'EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS', 'E.R.Burroughs']",,/type/text,"Edgar Rice Burroughs was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of a businessman.  During the Chicago influenza epidemic in 1891, he spent half a year on his brothers' ranch on the Raft River in Idaho.  He attended the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and then the Michigan Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1895.  He failed the entrance exam for West Point, and so became an enlisted soldier with the 7th U.S. Cavalry in Fort Grant, Arizona Territory.  He was discharged in 1897, having been found ineligible for service due to a heart problem.

He drifted, working odd jobs at ranches across Idaho, then came to work at his father's firm in 1899.  He married Emma Centennia Hulbert in 1900.  In 1904 he left his job and found less regular work, ending up back in Chicago.  He held several low-wage jobs for the next seven years, then, while working as a pencil sharpener wholesaler, he began to write fiction in 1911.  He began reading pulp fiction magazines and decided to aim his fiction toward getting published in these magazines.  His first published story, ""Under the Moons of Mars,"" was serialized in The All-Story magazine in 1912.  He began writing full-time and his first published novel, Tarzan of the Apes, was published in October of 1912.

In 1919 he purchased a ranch north of Los Angeles, California which he named ""Tarzana,"" a name which was later adopted by the citizens of the community that sprang up around the ranch.  In 1923 he set up Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. and began printing his own books.  He divorced Emma in 1934 and married former actress Florence Gilbert Dearholt in 1935.  In 1941, when Pearl Harbor, Hawaii was attacked, he was a resident of Hawaii and he volunteered to become the oldest war correspondent for the U.S. during World War II.  He divorced his second wife in 1942.  After the war he moved back to Encino, California, where, after many health problems, he died of a heart attack in March of 1950.

His major works, however, are long visionary poems which included Prometheus Unbound, Alastor, Adonaïs, The Revolt of Islam, and the unfinished The Triumph of Life. The Cenci (1819) and Prometheus Unbound (1820) were dramatic plays in five and four acts respectively. He also wrote the Gothic novels Zastrozzi (1810) and St. Irvyne (1811) and the short works The Assassins (1814) and The Coliseum (1817).

His father held a number of jobs, and his family moved many times in his childhood before settling in Brooklyn when he was about seven.  He attended Brooklyn Tech high school, but dropped out and took a job to help support his family.  As a teen, he founded the New York science fiction writer's group The Futurians.

0,,,/type/text,"Derek Alton Walcott is a Caribbean poet, playwright, writer and visual artist. Born in Castries, Saint Lucia[1], he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992.

His work, which developed independently of the schools of magic realism emerging in both South America and Europe at around the time of his birth, is intensely related to the symbolism of myth and its relationship to culture. He is best known for his epic poem Omeros, an allusive, loose reworking of Homeric story and tradition into a journey within the Caribbean and beyond to the Africa, New England, the American West, Canada, and London (with frequent reference to the Greek Islands).

Walcott founded the Trinidad Theatre Workshop in 1959, which has produced his plays (and others) since that time, and remains active with its Board of Directors. He also founded Boston Playwrights' Theatre at Boston University in 1981 with the hope of creating a home for new plays in Boston, Massachusetts. Walcott retired from teaching poetry and drama in the Creative Writing Department at Boston University in 2007. In fall 2009, he will commence a three year distinguished scholar in residence position at University of Alberta. He continues to give readings and lectures throughout the world. He divides his time between his home in the Caribbean and New York City.

0,,,/type/text,"Alberto Moravia is an Italian journalist, short-story writer, and novelist known for his fictional portrayals of social alienation and loveless sexuality. He was a major figure in 20th-century Italian literature.

Moravia contracted tuberculosis of the bone (a form of osteomyelitis usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis) at the age of 8, but, during several years in which he was confined to bed and two years in sanatoriums, he studied French, German, and English; read Giovanni Boccaccio, Ludovico Ariosto, William Shakespeare, and Molire; and began to write. Moravia was a journalist for a time in Turin and a foreign correspondent in London. His first novel, Gli indifferenti (1929; Time of Indifference), is a scathingly realistic study of the moral corruption of a middle-class mother and two of her children. It became a sensation. Some of his more important novels are Agostino (1944; Two Adolescents); La Romana (1947; The Woman of Rome); La disubbidienza (1948; Disobedience); and Il conformista (1951; The Conformist), all on themes of isolation and alienation. La ciociara (1957; Two Women) tells of an adaptation to post-World War II Italian life. La noia (1960; The Empty Canvas) is the story of a painter unable to find meaning either in love or work. Many of Moravia's books were made into motion pictures.

His books of short stories include Racconti romani (1954; Roman Tales) and Nuovi racconti romani (1959; More Roman Tales). Racconti di Alberto Moravia (1968) is a collection of earlier stories. Later short-story collections include Il paradiso (1970; “Paradise”) and Boh (1976; The Voice of the Sea and Other Stories).

Most of Moravia's works deal with emotional aridity, isolation, and existential frustration and express the futility of either sexual promiscuity or conjugal love as an escape. Critics have praised the author's stark, unadorned style, his psychological penetration, his narrative skill, and his ability to create authentic characters and realistic dialogue.

Moravia's views on literature and realism are expressed in a stimulating book of essays, L'uomo come fine (1963; Man as an End), and his autobiography, Alberto Moravia's Life, was published in 1990. He was married for a time to the novelist Elsa Morante.

Nabokov wrote his first nine novels in Russian, then rose to international prominence as a master English prose stylist. He also made contributions to entomology and had an interest in chess problems.

Nabokov's *Lolita* (1955) is frequently cited as among his most important novels and is his most widely known, exhibiting the love of intricate word play and synesthetic detail that characterised all his works. The novel was ranked at #4 in the list of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels. *Pale Fire* (1962) was ranked at #53 on the same list. His memoir entitled *Speak, Memory* was listed #8 on the Modern Library nonfiction list. ([Source][1].)

Montgomery was a Canadian author, best known for a series of novels beginning with *Anne of Green Gables*, published in 1908.

Once published, *Anne of Green Gables* was an immediate success. The central character, Anne, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. The novels became the basis for the highly acclaimed 1985 CBC television miniseries, Anne of Green Gables and several other television movies and programs, including Road to Avonlea, which ran in Canada and the U.S. from 1990-1996.

Catholic novelist, dramatist, and memorialist, born of American parents from the Southern states, which serve as a location for some of his fiction, but brought up in Paris and of French nationality. His early novels, such as Mont-Cinère (1926), Adrienne Mesurat (1927), and Léviathan (1928), evoke a claustrophobic world in which the characters' attempts to escape turn to passion, violence, and madness; they reflect Green's difficulties in reconciling sexuality, particularly homosexuality, with Catholicism. His work in the 1930s explores the possibility of escape from this bleak world through fantasy, and his later fiction, including Moïra (1950), Chaque homme dans sa nuit (1960), and L'Autre (1971), moves towards a more optimistic vision in which salvation is finally possible. In the 1950s he turned to drama, with three plays, Sud (1953), L'Ennemi (1954), and L'Ombre (1956), which show considerable dramatic talent and reflect the concerns of the novels. His spiritual and aesthetic evolution is recounted and explored in a third major area, his work as an autobiographer and, especially, diarist, whose Journal, begun in 1926, constitutes, with those of Gide and Mauriac, one of the major 20th-c. examples of the genre.

Over the next dozen years, her romance novels achieved much success, as was evidenced by her winning the Romantic Times Reviewer's Choice Award, The Holt Medallion, and Walden Books' Best Seller award. She has been inducted into the Missouri Writers Hall of Fame.

Despite her success in more mainstream romantic fiction, in 1995, she decided to switch focus. Her subsequent books have been in the relatively new subgenre of Christian romance. She has also collaborated with authors Angela Elwell Hunt or Virginia Smith on a series of Christian romance novels.

Lori and her husband of over forty years, Lance, live in Springfield, Missouri, surrounded by the beautiful Ozarks. They have three grown sons, three daughter-in-laws, and six wonderful grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters. She and her husband are very involved in their church, and active in supporting mission work in Mali, West Africa.",12 June 1941,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL27316A,/type/datetime,2015-02-15T14:26:46.659202,5.0,,,,Lori Copeland,Lori Copeland,,[7322980],5,,,,/type/author,,,1941-06-12 00:00:00,,76.0

0,,,/type/text,"Jessica Steele was born on May 9, 1933 in the elegant Warwickshire town of Royal Leamington Spa. She has two super brothers, Colin and George, and a lovely sister, Elizabeth. She was a delicate child and missed a lot of school. In fact, she left school at aged 14, when she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis. At 16, she started work as a junior clerk. In 1967, Jessica married with her husband, Peter and within a very short space of time they had moved from her hometown to the lovely area where they now live. Their house is built into the side of a hill, and has beautiful views over more hills and valleys. Her brothers and her sister are very close and she has plenty of nephews and nieces to make up for the fact that she and her husband have no children of their own. Both she and her husband are more than a little dog-oriented, and their current dog is a Staffordshire bull terrier named Florence. Florence is gorgeous. She loves everybody but, since she is 40 pounds of dynamite and would hurl her boisterous self at everyone she meets - given half a chance - she has to be restrained (as much as possible). She is fun.

Her husband spurred Jessica on to her writing career, giving her every support while she did what she considers her five-year apprenticeship (the rejection years) while learning how to write. She published her first books in 1979. Jessica has tried using a typewriter, but it just doesn't work for her. She is much happier writing in longhand, and in actual fact has a dozen or so fountain pens filled and ready to go at the start of any one session. A friend has a secretarial agency and, after deciphering Jessica's writing, returns an immaculately typed manuscript. To gain authentic background for her books, she has travelled and researched in Greece, Russia, Egypt, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Hong Kong, China and Japan.",9 May 1933,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL687900A,/type/datetime,2010-08-08T12:13:02.649120,4.0,,,,Jessica Steele,Jessica Steele,,[6457637],4,,,,/type/author,,,1933-05-09 00:00:00,,84.0

0,"['Eleanor Marie Robertson Aufdem-Brinke Wilder', 'J. D. Robb', 'Jill March', 'Nora Roberts ... [et al.]']",,/type/text,"Eleanor Marie Robertson was born on October 10, 1950 in Silver Spring, Maryland, U.S.A. She was the youngest of the five children, also the only girl, of a marriage with Irish ancestors. Her family were avid readers, so books were always important in her life. She attended a Catholic school and credits the nuns with instilling in her a sense of discipline. During her sophomore year in high school, she transferred to a local public school, where she met Ronald Aufdem-Brinke, her future first husband.

In Augusy 17, 1968, as soon as she had graduated from High School, Eleanor married, against her parents' wishes. The marriage settled in Keedysville, Maryland. Her husband worked at his father's sheet-metal business before joining her parents in their lighting company. While, she worked briefly as a legal secretary. ""I could type fast but couldn't spell, I was the worst legal secretary ever,"" she says now. After their sons, Dan and Jason, were born she stayed home. Calling this her ""Earth Mother"" years, she spent much of her time doing crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children's clothes. The marriage ended separating, and they obtained the divorce in January 1985.

In February 1979, a blizzard in forced her hand to try another creative outlet. She was snowed in with a three and six year old with no kindergarten respite in sight and a dwindling supply of chocolate. During the now famous blizzard, she pulled out a pencil and notebook and began to write down one of those stories. It was there that a career was born. Several manuscripts and rejections later, her first book, Irish Thoroughbred, was published by Silhouette in 1981 as Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson, because she assumed that all authors had pen names.

Eleanor wrote under the pseudonym Jill March a story for a magazine titled ""Melodies of Love"". 

Eleanor met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, when she hired him to build bookshelves. They were married in July 1985. Her husband owns and operates a bookstore in Boonsboro, Maryland called ""Turn the Page Books"". Since that time, they've expanded their home, traveled the world.

In 1992, she decided adopted other pseudonym so to publish a futuristic-suspense novels, she first decided to use the pseudonym D.J. MacGregor, but she discovered that this pseudonym was used by another author. In 1995, her first ""In Death"" serial novel was published under the pseudonym J.D. Robb, the initials ""J.D."" were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while ""Robb"" is a shortened form of Roberts.

Eleanor has also been known as Sara Hardesty, because when the ""Born In"" series was released in U.K. it carried that name instead of Nora Roberts. She has since changed publishers.

Eleanor has been plagiarized by another best-selling romance writer, Janet Dailey. The practice came to light after a reader read Nora Roberts' ""Sweet Revenge"" and Janet Dailey's ""Notorious"" back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism ""mind rape,"" Eleanor sued Janet Daily. In 1997, Janet, admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing from Nora Roberts' work, and that both ""Aspen Gold"" and ""Notorious"" lifted heavily from Nora Roberts's work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Janet's admission. She acknowledged the plagiarism and blamed it on a psychological disorder. In a settlement, Janet paid Eleanor an undisclosed sum, which Eleanor donated to the Literacy Volunteers of America.

A founding member of the Romance Writers of America (R.W.A.), she was the first inductee in the organization's Hall of Fame. She also is a member of several writers groups and has won countless awards from her colleagues and the publishing industry.

In 1989, Nora Roberts's novel ""Magic Moments"" had been made into TV movie, also ""Sanctuary"" (Melissa Gilbert) in 2001. In 2007 Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts's novels into TV movies: , ""Montana Sky"" (Ashley Williams), ""Carolina Moon"" (Claire Forlani), ""Blue Smoke"" (Alicia Witt) and ""Angel's Fall"" (Heather Locklear).",10 October 1950,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,"Robertson Aufdem-Brinke Wilder, Eleanor Marie",/authors/OL18977A,/type/datetime,2013-03-01T03:18:51.460636,15.0,,"Boonsboro, Maryland, U.S.A.",,Nora Roberts,"Robertson, Eleanor Marie",,"[6962008, 3365766, -1]",15,,,,/type/author,http://www.NoraRoberts.com,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_Roberts,1950-10-10 00:00:00,,67.0

0,['Frank Morrison Spillane'],,/type/text,"Frank Morrison Spillane (March 9, 1918 – July 17, 2006), better known as Mickey Spillane, was an American author of crime novels, many featuring his signature detective character, Mike Hammer. More than 225 million copies of his books have sold internationally. In 1980, Spillane was responsible for seven of the top 15 all-time best-selling fiction titles in the U.S.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Spillane was the only child of his Irish bartender father, John Joseph Spillane, and his Scottish mother, Catherine Anne. Spillane attended Erasmus Hall High School, graduating in 1935. He started writing while in high school, briefly attended Fort Hays State College in Kansas and worked a variety of jobs, including summers as a life-guard at Breezy Point, Queens, and a period as a trampoline artist for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
During World War II Spillane enlisted in the Army Air Corps, becoming a fighter pilot and a flight instructor.
Mickey and Mary Ann Spillane had four children (Caroline, Kathy, Michael, Ward), and their marriage ended in 1962. In November 1965, he married his second wife, nightclub singer Sherri Malinou. After that marriage ended in divorce (and a lawsuit) in 1983, Spillane shared his waterfront house in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, with his third wife, Jane Rogers Johnson, whom he married in October 1983, and her two daughters (Jennifer and Margaret Johnson).
In 1989, Hurricane Hugo ravaged his Murrells Inlet house to such a degree it had to be almost entirely reconstructed. A television interview showed Spillane standing in the ruins of his house. He received an Edgar Allan Poe Grand Master Award in 1995. Spillane's novels went out of print, but in 2001, the New American Library began reissuing them.
Spillane died July 17, 2006 at his home in Murrells Inlet, of pancreatic carcinoma. After his death, his friend and literary executor, Max Allan Collins, began the task of editing and completing Spillane's unpublished typescripts, beginning with a Mike Hammer novel, The Goliath Bone (2008).

**Writing career**

Comic books
Spillane started as a writer for comic books. While working as a salesman in Gimbels department store basement in 1940, he met tie salesman Joe Gill, who later found a lifetime career in scripting for Charlton Comics. Gill told Spillane to meet his brother, Ray Gill, who wrote for Funnies, Inc., an outfit that packaged comic books for different publishers. Spillane soon began writing an eight-page story every day. He concocted adventures for major 1940s comic book characters, including Captain Marvel, Superman, Batman and Captain America. Two-page text stories, which he wrote in the mid-1940s for Timely, appeared under his name and were collected in Primal Spillane (Gryphon Books, 2003).
Novels
Spillane joined the United States Army Air Forces on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the mid-1940s he was stationed as a flight instructor in Greenwood, Mississippi, where he met and married Mary Ann Pearce in 1945. The couple wanted to buy a country house in the Newburgh, New York, 60 miles north of New York City, so Spillane decided to boost his bank account by writing a novel. In 19 days he wrote I, the Jury. At the suggestion of Ray Gill, he sent it to E. P. Dutton.
With the combined total of the 1947 hardcover and the Signet paperback (December 1948), I, the Jury sold six and a half million copies in the United States alone. I, the Jury introduced Spillane's most famous character, hardboiled detective Mike Hammer. Although tame by current standards, his novels featured more sex than competing titles, and the violence was more overt than the usual detective story. An early version of Spillane's Mike Hammer character, called Mike Danger, was submitted in a script for a detective-themed comic book. "" 'Mike Hammer originally started out to be a comic book. I was gonna have a Mike Danger comic book,' [Spillane] said in a 1984 interview."" Two Mike Danger comic-book stories were published in 1954 without Spillane's knowledge, as well as one featuring Mike Lancer (1942), were published with other material in ""Byline: Mickey Spillane,"" edited by Max Allan Collins and Lynn F. Myers, Jr. (Crippen & Landru publishers, 2004).
The Signet paperbacks displayed dramatic front cover illustrations. Lou Kimmel did the cover paintings for My Gun Is Quick, Vengeance Is Mine, One Lonely Night and The Long Wait. The cover art for Kiss Me, Deadly was by James Meese.

0,,,/type/text,"John Fante was an American novelist, short story writer and screenwriter of Italian descent.

By far, his most popular novel is the semi-autobiographical *Ask the Dust*, the third book in what is now referred to as ""The Saga of Arturo Bandini"" or ""The Bandini Quartet"". Bandini served as his alter ego in a total of four novels: *Wait Until Spring, Bandini* (1938), *The Road to Los Angeles* (chronologically, this is the first novel Fante wrote but it was unpublished until 1985), *Ask the Dust* (1939), and finally *Dreams from Bunker Hill* (1982), which was dictated to his wife, Joyce, towards the end of his life. Fante's use of Bandini as his alter ego can be compared to Charles Bukowski's character, Henry Chinaski. Bukowski was heavily influenced by John Fante.

0,['Jude Gilliam White Montassir'],"Jude Gilliam was born September 20, 1947 in Fairdale, Kentucky. She has a large extended family, and is the elder sister of four brothers. She attended Murray State University and received a degree in Art. In 1967, Jude married and took her husband's surname of White, but four years later they divorced. For years, she worked as 5th-grade teacher.

She began writing in 1976 and her first book, The Enchanted land was published in 1977 as Jude Deveraux. Following the publication of her first novel, she resigned her teaching position. Now, she is the author of thirty-one New York Times bestsellers. Jude won readers' hearts with the epic Velvet series, which revolves around the lives of the Montgomery family's irresistible men. Jude's early books are set largely in 15th- and 16th-century England, in which her fierce, impassioned protagonists find themselves in the midst of blood feuds and wars. Her heroines are equally scrappy -- medieval Scarlett O'Haras who often have a low regard for the men who eventually win them over. They're fighters, certainly, but they're also beauties who are preoccupied with survival and family preservation. Jude has also stepped outside her milieu, with mixed results. Her James River trilogy (River Lady, Lost Lady, and Counterfeit Lady) is set mostly in post-Revolution America; the popular, softer-edged Twin of Fire/Twin of Ice moves to 19th-century Colorado and introduces another hunky-man clan, the Taggerts. Deveraux manages to evoke a strong and convincing atmosphere for each of her books, but her dialogue and characters are as familiar as a modern-day soap opera's. ""Historicals seem to be all I'm capable of,"" Jude once said in an interview, referring to a now out-of-print attempt at contemporary fiction, 1982's Casa Grande. ""I don't want to write family sagas or occult books, and I have no intention of again trying to ruin the contemporary market."" Still, Jude did later attempt modern-day romances, such as the lighthearted High Tide (her first murder caper), the contemporary female friendship story The Summerhouse, and the time-traveling Knight in Shining Armor. In fact, with 2002's The Mulberry Tree, Deveraux seems to be getting more comfortable setting stories in the present, which is a good thing, since the fans she won with her historical books are eager to follow her into the future.

Jude married Claude Montassir, with whom she had a son, Sam Alexander Montassir in 1997. They were eventually divorced. On Oct. 6th, 2005, Sam died at the age of eight in a motorcycle accident. Jude has lived in several countries and all over the United States. She currently lives in Charlotte, North Carolina and also has a home in the medieval city of Badolato, Italy.",,,20 September 1947,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL68291A,/type/datetime,2016-03-15T07:58:50.304225,6.0,,,,Jude Deveraux,Jude Deveraux,,[6457645],6,,,,/type/author,,,1947-09-20 00:00:00,,70.0

Rucker is regarded as contemporary master of science-fiction, and received the Philip K. Dick award twice. His thirty published books include both novels and non-fiction books on the fourth dimension, infinity, and the meaning of computation.

A founder of the cyberpunk school of science-fiction, Rucker also writes SF in a realistic style known as transrealism. His 2006 Mathematicians in Love was an example of a transreal novel. His early cyberpunk four-book series was republished in 2010 as The Ware Tetralogy.

Rucker’s 2007 novel, Postsingular was something of a return to the cyberpunk style, as was the 2009 sequel, Hylozoic, in which every object on Earth comes to life. Rucker’s autobiography, , appeared in 2011. Recent novels include Jim and the Flims, Turing & Burroughs, and The Big Aha.

In 1926 she graduated from John Burroughs School and then attended Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia.  In 1927, she left before graduating to pursue a career as a journalist.  In 1930 she went to France for two years where she worked as a foreign correspondent for the United Press.  While in Europe, she became active in the pacifist movement, which she wrote about in her first book, What Mad Pursuit (1934).  Upon returning to the U.S., she worked as an investigator for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, reporting on the impact of the Depression on the United States.  Her reports caught the attention of Eleanor Roosevelt, and the two women became lifelong friends.  In 1936, on a trip to Key West, she met the author Ernest Hemingway.  They travelled together in Spain, where she was reporting on the Spanish Civil War for Collier's Weekly.  Later, she reported on the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany and in 1938 she was working in Czechoslovakia.  She later reported the war from Finland, Hong Kong, Burma, Singapore and Britain.  She was among the first journalists to report from Dachau concentration camp after it was liberated.

She married Hemingway in 1940, but her career as a journalist kept travelling for long periods of time, and they divorced in 1945.  After the war, she covered the Vietnam War, the Six-Day War in the Middle East, and the civil wars in Central America for the Atlantic Monthly.  In 1949, she adopted a son from an Italian orphanage, and although she was briefly a devoted mother, she soon left him to the care of her relatives in Englewood, and he eventually ended up in boarding school.  She married Tom Matthews, editor-in-chief of Time magazine, in 1954; they were divorced in 1963.

Aged 81, she travelled impromptu to Panama, where she wrote on the U.S. invasion.  Only when the Bosnian war broke out in the 1990s did she concede she was too old to continue her career as a war correspondent.  She died in London in 1998, aged 89, taking her own life after a long battle with cancer and near total blindness.  She is considered to be one of the greatest war correspondents of the 20th century.

Gellhorn published a large number of books, including a collection of articles on war, The Face of War (1959), a novel about McCarthyism, The Lowest Trees Have Tops (1967), an account of her travels (including one trip with Ernest Hemingway), Travels With Myself and Another (1978) and a collection of her peacetime journalism, The View From the Ground (1988).

Lamb']","Sheila Ann Mary Coates was born on 1937 in Essex, England, just before the Second World War in the East End of London. As a child, she was moved from relative to relative to escape the bombings of World War II. 

Sheila attended the Ursuline Convent for Girls. On leaving school at 16, the convent-educated author worked for the Bank of England as a clerk. Sheila continued her education by taking advantage of the B of E's enormous library during her lunch breaks and after work. She later worked as a secretary for the BBC. While there, she met and married Richard Holland, a political reporter. 

A voracious reader of romance novels, she began writing at her husband's suggestion. She wrote her first book in three days with three children underfoot! In between raising her five children (including a set of twins), Charlotte wrote several more novels. She used both her married and maiden names, Sheila Holland and Sheila Coates, before her first novel as Charlotte Lamb, Follow a Stranger, was published by Mills & Boon in 1973. She also used the pennames: Sheila Lancaster, Victoria Wolf and Laura Hardy. 

Sheila was a true revolutionary in the field of romance writing. One of the first writers to explore the boundaries of sexual desire, her novels often reflected the forefront of the ""sexual revolution"" of the 1970s. Her books touched on then-taboo subjects such as child abuse and rape, and she created sexually confident - even dominant - heroines. She was also one of the first to create a modern romantic heroine: independent, imperfect, and perfectly capable of initiating a sexual or romantic relationship. 

A prolific author, Sheila penned more than 160 novels, most of them for Mills & Boon. Known for her swiftness as well as for her skill in writing, Sheila typically wrote a minimum of two thousand words per day, working from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. While she once finished a full-length novel in four days, she herself pegged her average speed at two weeks to complete a full novel. 

Since 1977, Sheila had been living on the Isle of Man as a tax exile with her husband and four of their five children: Michael Holland, Sarah Holland, Jane Holland, Charlotte Holland and David Holland. Sheila passed away on October 8, 2000 in her baronial-style home 'Crogga' on the Island. She is greatly missed by her many fans, and by the romance writing community.",,,1937,,/type/datetime,2008-09-15T21:53:57.797547,,8 October 2000,,Sheila Ann Mary Coates Holland,/authors/OL4728806A,/type/datetime,2010-08-17T13:11:03.410252,5.0,,UK,,Charlotte Lamb,Sheila Ann Mary Coates Holland,,"[5539728, 5539720]",5,,,,/type/author,http://www.charlottelamb.blogspot.com,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Lamb,1937-04-05 00:00:00,2000-10-08 00:00:00,63.0

She married her high school sweetheart just before he left for the US Air Force as a helicopter pilot during the Vietnam War. Carr followed her new husband from base to base, and because they did not stay in any one place for very long, she was unable to pursue her nursing career. When a difficult pregnancy required her to be off of her feet, Carr turned to romance novels to distract herself. She soon decided to write her own novels.

Carr has since published dozens of historical and contemporary romance novels, a suspense novel, a non-fiction work, short stories, articles, and even wrote several screenplays which have yet to be sold.

For several years, he was a popular English teacher at R.L. Paschal High School, remembered as a spinner of first-person yarns and a resolutely independent soul. ""He got peeved at the principal one day,"" recalls history teacher Zelma Rhodes, ""and he up and quit."" Single, he lived quietly in a plain, two-story brick home with his mother, Beatrice, in Fort Worth, Texas. To preserved his identity, he made himself as elusive and reclusive as possible during years.

Long a dabbler at writing, Tom researched laboriously and wrote and rewrites with his typewriter in a tidy workroom. Published since 1968, during the first nine years he wrote under the female pseudonyms Edwina Marlow, Beatrice Parker, T. E. Huff, and Katherine St. Clair. ""You just work like hell and maybe, if you're lucky, you'll make it,"" he said ""I had to turn out three gothics a year to make a living."" He also explained the use of female identities: ""There's a certain mystique about this stuff, you see,"" he says earnestly ""If those women who buy my books ever get the idea that a man has written them, it could put a block in their minds.""

In 1976, when he began writing historical romance novels, he created his most famous female pseudonym Jennifer Wilde. His first release, Love's Tender Fury, had 41 printings in its first five years and sold more than 2.5 million copies, and his second historical romance, Dare to Love, spent 11 weeks on the New York Times paperback bestseller list. His historical romances were noted for being written in first-person, from the heroine's perspective. Many of his books also featured multiple male protagonists, and ""the man who first captures the heroine's heart isn't always the one who ends up with it."" Curiously, about his romance novels he said  ""aren't the real Tom E. Huff. I don't take the genre seriously-but I take my work seriously. My goal has been to reach a point where I can write what I want to.The Jennifer Wilde thing will be over with,"" he sighs, adding as if in pain, ""I don't relate to her at all."" In 1980, he wrote a novel as Tom E. Huff, but he continued writing as Jennifer Wilde, and his previous novels were reedited in many cases under this pseudonym.

Tom earned a Career Achievement Award in 1987-1988 from Romantic Times.

His father intended his son to have a scientific career, was initially educated at King's School, Rochester, Kent. He left home at the age of 18 and became at different times a children's encyclopedia salesman, a salesman in a bookshop, and executive for a book wholesaler before turning to a writing career that produced more than 90 mystery books. His interests included photography (he was up to professional standard), reading and listening to classical music, being a particularly enthusiastic opera lover. Also as a form of relaxation between novels, he put together highly complicated and sophisticated Meccano models.

In 1932, Raymond married Sylvia Ray, who gave him a son. They were together until his death fifty three years later. Prohibition and the ensuing US Great Depression (1929–1939), had given rise to the Chicago gangster culture just prior to World War II. This, combined with her book trade experience, made him realise that there was a big demand for gangster stories. He wrote as R. Raymond, James Hadley Chase, James L. Docherty, Ambrose Grant and Raymond Marshall.

During World War II he served in the Royal Air Force, achieving the rank of Squadron Leader. Chase edited the RAF Journal with David Langdon and had several stories from it published after the war in the book Slipstream: A Royal Air Force Anthology.

Raymond moved to France in 1956 and then to Switzerland in 1969, living a secluded life in Corseaux-sur-Vevey, on Lake Geneva, from 1974.

Her parents were both descended from Russian nobility. From age 7 to 13 she and her family spent their summers in a dacha near Sevastopol. She started writing poetry at the age of 11, and was first published at age 17. Her father did not want poetry published under his name, so she adopted her grandmother's surname ""Akhmatova"" and published under the name Anna Akhmatova.

In 1905 her parents separated, and in 1906 she moved to Kiev. In 1910, she married another poet, Nikolay Gumilev and began attending Kiev University to study law. After one year, she then moved to St Petersburg to study literature. She became known in literary circles in St Petersburg's and gave regular public readings of her work. In 1910, she co-founded the influential Guild of Poets, which went on to develop the Acmeist anti-symbolist school of poetry.

In 1912, she published her first book, *Evening*, with the Guild of Poets. She also gave birth to a son, Lev.

In 1918, at the height of her fame, she ended her difficult marriage to Nikolay Gumilev and went on to marry another poet, Vladimir Shilejko. She shortly began having affairs again. In 1921 her first husband was executed for his alleged role in a monarchist anti-Bolshevik conspiracy. His execution, along with those of 61 others of Russia's intelligentsia, led to the break-up of the Acmeist poetry group.

Akhmatova and her son Lev were criticized by the Marxist state as representing a ""bourgeois aesthetic"", and in 1925 her work was unofficially banned. She continued to write (but not to publish) poetry while working as a translator and critic. Because of his parentage, her son Lev was denied admission to academic institutions and was imprisoned several times on accusations of counter-revolutionary activity. She queued for hours to deliver him food packages and plead on his behalf.

Akhmatova married Nikolai Punin, and stayed with him until 1935. He was also repeatedly imprisoned and in 1953 he died in the Gulag. Stalin approved the publication of one volume of her poetry, but it was withdrawn and pulped after only a few months. During this time, the government kept her under surveillance, going so far as to place recording devices in her flat, and produced 900 pages of reports on her. Despite this suppression, her work continued was secretly circulated in the gulags.

During World War II, Akhmatova read to soldiers in military hospitals and on the front line. She witnessed the 900 day Siege of Leningrad, and in 1940, she began to write ""Poem without a Hero"", which she considered to be her major work. In 1946 she received a visit from the liberal, western, Jewish philosopher Isaiah Berlin in 1946, and was accusing by the government of poisoning the minds of Soviet youth. Surveillance of her was increased and she was expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers.

In 1949 Akhmatova's son Lev was sentenced to 10 years in a Siberian prison camp. She spent several years trying to get him released, and she began to publish overtly propagandist poetry praising Stalin and his regime, although she did not consider this work, which may have saved both her life and her son's, as part of her official corpus. In 1951 she was readmitted to Union of Writers. In 1956 her son Lev was released from the prison camp, and her poetry began to be published again. Several books of her collected poetry were published in the following years.

In 1962 she was visited by Robert Frost and in her dacha in Komarovo she met with young Russian poets. In the 1960s she had become more popular in the than she had been before the revolution. Even the government came to recognize her as one of the major poets of the Silver Age, and she was permitted to travel. She visited Sicily and England, meeting with some pre-revolutionary friends and receiving the Taromina Prize. She died shortly after returning to Russia. Thousands attended the two memorial ceremonies which were held in Moscow and in Leningrad. After being displayed in an open coffin, she was interred at Komarovo Cemetery in St Petersburg.

One of the foremost American humorists of the 20th century, his inimitable wit and pithy prose spanned a breadth of genres, including short stories, modern commentary, fiction, children's fantasy and letters.

Thurber's father, Charles, was a civil clerk, and his mother, Mame, was an eccentric woman who would influence many of her son's stories. Thurber had two brothers, William and Robert. One day while playing ""William Tell"" with them as youngsters, Thurber lost the sight in one eye when an arrow pierced it. Ultimately, he would go blind in both eyes, but that never stopped him from writing or drawing.

Thurber CarnivalFrom 1913-1917, Thurber attended the Ohio State University where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. It was at this time that the Thurbers rented the house at 77 Jefferson Avenue, which became Thurber House in 1984. Due to his eye injury, Thurber was not able to complete a compulsory ROTC course so OSU would not let him graduate, although they did give him an honorary degree later.

Thurber launched his professional writing career as a reporter for the Columbus Dispatch in 1920. He began writing for the New Yorker in 1927 after friend E.B. White (Charlotte's Web) got him a job at the magazine. Thurber started as an editor for the magazine but quickly became a writer. His career as a cartoonist began in 1930, when White dug some of Thurber's drawings out of the trash and submitted them to be published in the New Yorker.

Thurber wrote nearly forty books and won a Tony Award for his popular Broadway play, A Thurber Carnival, in which he often starred as himself.

Thurber died of complications from pneumonia on November 2, 1961.

0,['Samuel Morris Steward'],,/type/text,"Samuel Morris Steward, also known by the pen name Phil Andros, was a novelist and tattoo artist later based in Oakland, California. He was born in Woodsfield, Ohio and attended the Ohio State University. He began teaching English at OSU as a university fellow in 1932 during the final year of his PhD and was given his first post as a university professor in 1934 at Carroll College in Helena, Montana. In 1936 he was dismissed from a position at the State College of Washington due to the portrayal of prostitution in his novel Angels on the Bough. He moved to Chicago, teaching at Loyola until 1946 and then at DePaul University. In 1952 he began tattooing in Chicago under the name Phil Sparrow partly because he did not want to jepardize his teaching job at DePaul. He stopped teaching two years later to write and tattoo full time.

In 1932 he was taking college courses from Clarence Andrews, who had written a book which was the vehicle for Maurice Chevalier's first American movie. Mr. Andrews spent half the year in Paris, where he visited Gertrude Stein many times and then returned to teaching for six months in the U.S, where he told Steward about her. After Andrews died suddenly in 1932, Steward wrote to tell her of his death, and began a long correspondence and friendship with Stein. He visited Paris in 1937 and met her and Alice B. Toklas with whom he corresponded for 20 years after Stein's death. He also met with many other literary figures such as Lord Alfred Douglas (the lover of Oscar Wilde), Thomas Mann, and André Gide. Gide once loaned to him for an evening the beautiful young Arab boy that Gide had brought from North Africa to France. Steward's 1981 memoir Chapters from an Autobiography detailed these relationships, as well as other experiences. He also edited the book Dear Sammy: Letters from Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas (Houghton Mifflin, 1977), and wrote two ""Gertrude Stein-Alice B. Toklas Mysteries"" featuring the famous couple as detectives. Steward was also introduced to Thornton Wilder by Gertrude Stein, who at the time regularly corresponded with the both of them. Wilder famously drafted the third act of Our Town during a brief affair with Steward in Zurich on their first meeting.

Steward met famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey around 1949 and became an unofficial collaborator, helping Kinsey find new contacts. In 1949, he participated in a BDSM scene for Kinsey to film, with a sadist that Kinsey flew in from New York. He said Kinsey was ""as approachable as a park bench"" and described him as a liberating influence.
In the early 1950s he made pornographic drawings, many of them based on his own Polaroid photographs. Some of his art was published in the trilingual Swiss homosexual journal Der Kreis (The Circle).

In the 1960s Steward began writing gay erotica under the name Phil Andros. His works dealt with rough trade and sadomasochistic sex. Since the legality of gay erotica was still questionable, its authors and publishers had little recourse against piracy; Steward's own San Francisco Hustler was published without permission by Cameo Library as Gay in San Francisco by ""Biff Thomas"". The name Phil Andros, which he used both as a pen name and the name of his protagonist, comes from the Greek words for love and man.

Steward died at age 84 of chronic pulmonary disease in Berkeley, California.

It was only after responding to an advertisement for a summer school course in creative writing, at the University of British Columbia, that he was encouraged to believe that he had an aptitude for writing. 
Over the next eight years, Hull continued to study and write in his spare time, attending night school and summer school courses, writers' clubs and conferences, all the time supporting himself by a succession of low paying jobs. 
After years writing short stories and poetry, Hull began to write and sell television plays to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He branched into the writing of stage plays and eventually formed The Gastown Players, a semi-professional company specializing in the production of melodramas, including his own plays: The Drunkard, Son of the Drunkard (now known as The Drunkard's Revenge), and Wedded to a Villain, all of which are published by Pioneer Drama Service. 
Hull next began writing magazine articles and non-fiction books, teaching night school classes, and lecturing on creative writing. 
He is best known as the co-author of the book, The Peter Principle.

As part of the decadent movement, his influence on modern literature, music and art has been enduring and pervasive. He produced his best known works while still in his late teens—Victor Hugo described him at the time as ""an infant Shakespeare""—and gave up creative writing altogether before he reached 21. He remained a prolific letter-writer all his life. Rimbaud was known to have been a French Libertine and a restless soul, traveling extensively on three continents before his death from cancer less than a month after his 37th birthday.

0,,,/type/text,"John Henry Noyes Collier (3 May 1901 – 6 April 1980) was a British-born author and screenplay writer best known for his short stories, many of which appeared in The New Yorker from the 1930s to the 1950s. They were collected in a 1951 volume, Fancies and Goodnights, which won the International Fantasy Award and remains in print. Individual stories are frequently anthologized in fantasy collections. John Collier's writing has been praised by authors such as Anthony Burgess, Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl, Neil Gaiman, Michael Chabon and Paul Theroux. He was married to early silent film actress Shirley Palmer. His second marriage in 1942 was to New York actress Beth Kay (Margaret Elizabeth Eke). They divorced a decade later. He had one child, a son, from his third marriage.
Born in London in 1901, John Collier was privately educated by his uncle Vincent Collier, a novelist. When, at the age of 18 or 19, Collier was asked by his father what he had chosen as a vocation, his reply was, ""I want to be a poet."" His father indulged him; over the course of the next ten years Collier lived on an allowance of two pounds a week plus whatever he could pick up by writing book reviews and acting as a cultural correspondent for a Japanese newspaper. During this time, being not overly burdened by any financial responsibilities, he developed a penchant for games of chance, conversation in cafes and visits to picture galleries. He never attended university.

0,['Arthur Joyce Lunel Cary'],,/type/text,"Joyce Arthur Cary was an Irish novelist and artist born in Derry, Ireland. His family had been landlords in Donegal since Elizabethan times, but lost their property after passage of the Irish Land Act in 1882. Cary's grandfather died soon after and his grandmother moved into a cottage near Cary Castle, one of the lost family properties.

The family dispersed and Cary had uncles who served in the frontier US Cavalry and the Canadian North West Mounted Police. Most of the Carys wound up in England. Arthur Cary trained as an engineer and married Charlotte Joyce, the well-to-do daughter of a Belfast banker. After his son was born in 1888, Arthur moved his family to London.

Throughout his childhood, Joyce Cary spent many summers at his grandmother's house in Ireland and at Cromwell House in England, home of his great-uncle, which served as a base for all the Cary clan. Some of this upbringing is described in the fictionalized memoir A House of Children (1941) and the novel Castle Corner (1938), i.e., Cary Castle. Although he always remembered his Irish childhood with affection and wrote about it with great feeling, Cary was based in England the rest of his life. The feeling of displacement and the idea that life's tranquility may be disturbed at any moment marked Cary and informs much of his writing.

Cary's health was poor as a child. He was subject to asthma, which recurred throughout his life, and was nearly blind in one eye, which caused him to wear a monocle when he was in his twenties. Cary was educated at Clifton College in Bristol, England, where he was a member of Dakyns House. His mother died during this period, leaving Cary a small legacy which served as his financial base until the 1930s.

In 1906, determined to be an artist, Cary travelled to Paris. Discovering that he needed more technical training, Cary then studied art in Edinburgh. Soon enough, he determined that he could never be more than a third rate painter and decided to apply himself to literature. Cary published a volume of poems which, by his own later account, was pretty bad, and then entered Trinity College, Oxford. There he became friends with fellow-student John Middleton Murry and introduced Murry to Paris on a holiday together. Cary neglected his studies and left Oxford with a fourth class degree.

Seeking adventure, in 1912 Cary left for Montenegro and served as a Red Cross orderly during the Balkan Wars. Cary kept and illustrated a record of his experiences there, Memoir of the Bobotes (1964), that was not published until after his death.

Returning to England the next year, Cary sought a post with an Irish agricultural cooperative scheme, but the project fell through. Dissatisfied and believing that he lacked the education that would provide him with a good position in Britain, Cary joined the Nigerian political service. During the First World War Cary served with a Nigerian regiment fighting in the German colony of Cameroon. The short story ""Umaru"" (1921) describes an incident from this period in which a British officer recognizes the common humanity that connects him with his African sergeant.

Cary was wounded at the battle of Mount Mora in 1916. He returned to England on leave and proposed marriage to Gertrude Oglivie, the sister of a friend, whom he had been courting for years. Three months later, Cary returned to service as a colonial officer, leaving a pregnant Gertrude in England. Cary held several posts in Nigeria including that of magistrate and executive officer in Borgu. Cary began his African service as a stereotypical colonial officer, determined to bring order to the natives, but by the end of his service, he had come to see the Nigerians as individuals facing difficult problems, including those created by colonial rule.

By 1920, Cary was concentrating his energies on providing clean water and roads to connect remote villages with the larger world. A second leave in England had left Gertrude pregnant with their second child. She begged Cary to retire from government service so that they could live together in England. Cary had thought this impossible for financial reasons, but in 1920, he obtained a literary agent and some of the stories he had written while in Africa were sold to The Saturday Evening Post, an American magazine, published under the name ""Thomas Joyce"". This provided Cary with enough incentive to resign from the Nigerian service and he and Gertrude found a house in Oxford on Parks Road opposite the University Parks (now with a blue plaque) for their growing family. They would have four sons.

Cary worked hard on developing as a writer but his brief economic success soon ended as the Post decided that his stories had become too ""literary"". Cary worked at various novels and a play, but nothing sold and the family soon had to take in tenants. Their plight worsened when the Depression wiped out the investments that provided them with income and, at one point, the family rented out their house and lived with family members. Finally, in 1932, Cary managed to publish Aissa Saved, a novel that drew on his Nigerian experience. The book was not particularly successful, but sold more than Cary's next novel, An American Visitor (1933), even though that book had some critical success. The African Witch (1936) did a little better and the Carys managed to move back into their home.

Although none of Cary's first three novels was particularly successful critically or financially, they are progressively more ambitious and complex. Indeed, The African Witch (1936) is so rich in incident, character, and thematic possibility that it over-burdens its structure. Cary understood that he needed to find new ways to make the narrative form carry his ideas. With Mister Johnson (1939), written entirely in the present tense, Cary's work becomes generally identified with literary Modernism.

George Orwell, on his return from Spain, recommended Cary to the Liberal Book Club which requested Cary to put together a work outlining his ideas on freedom and liberty, a basic theme in all his novels. Released as Power in Men (1939) [not Cary's title], the publisher seriously cut the manuscript without Cary's approval and he was most unhappy with the book.

Now Cary contemplated a trilogy of novels based on his Irish background. Castle Corner (1938) did not do well and Cary abandoned the idea. One last African novel, Mister Johnson (1939), followed. Although now regarded as one of Cary's best novels, it sold poorly at the time. But Charley Is My Darling (1940), about displaced young people at the start of World War II, found a wider readership, and the memoir A House of Children (1941) won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for best novel.

0,['Kat Thorpe'],,/type/text,"Kay Thorpe was born on 1935 in England. An avid reader from the time when words on paper began to make sense, she developed a lively imagination of her own, making up stories for the entertainment of her young friends. After leaving school, she tried a variety of jobs, including dental nursing, and a spell in the Women's Royal Airforce from which she emerged knowing a whole lot more about life - if only as an observer.

In 1960, she married with Tony, but didn't begin thinking about trying her hand at writing for a living until she gave up work some four years later to have a baby, John. Having read Mills & Boon novels herself, and done some market research in the local library asking readers what it was they particularly liked about the books, she decided to aim for a particular market, and was fortunate to have her very first, completed manuscript accepted - The Last of the Mallorys, published in 1968. Since then she has written over seventy five books, which doesn't begin to compare with the output of some Mills & Boon authors, but still leaves her wondering where all those words came from.

Sometimes, she finds she has become two different people: the writer at her happiest when involved in the world of books and authors; and the housewife, turning her hands to the everyday needs of husband and son. Once in a while, she finds it difficult to step from one role to the other. She likes cooking, for instance, but she finds that it can be an irritating interruption when she's preoccupied with work on a novel, so the quality of her efforts in the kitchen tend to be a little erratic. She says, ""As my husband once remarked, my writing gives life a fascinating element of uncertainly: one day a perfect coq au vin, the next day a couple of burned chops!""

Luckily Kay has daily professional help with her housework, and that leaves her time to indulge in her hobbies. Like many other Mills & Boon authors, she admits to being a voracious consumer of books, a quality she shares with her readers. She likes music and horseback riding, which she does in the countryside near her home. But her favorite hobby is travel - especially to places that will make good settings for her books.

Kay now lives on the outskirts of Chesterfield in Derbyshire, along with husband, Tony, and a huge tabby cat called Mad Max her one son having flown the coop. Some day she'll think about retiring, but not yet awhile.",1935,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL661099A,/type/datetime,2011-10-14T23:27:07.940827,6.0,,,,Kay Thorpe,Kay Thorpe,,[6460623],6,,,,/type/author,,,1935-04-05 00:00:00,,82.0

That’s what having roots—and writing Roots—has done for me.

Dostoevsky's novels have much autobiographical elements, but ultimately they deal with moral and philosophical questions. He presented interacting characters with contrasting views or ideas about freedom of choice, Socialism, atheisms, good and evil, happiness and so forth. Dostoevsky's central obsession was God, whom his characters constantly search through painful errors and humiliations. ([Source][1])

Dostoyevsky's literary output explores human psychology in the troubled political, social and spiritual context of 19th-century Russian society. Considered by many as a founder or precursor of 20th-century existentialism, his *Notes from Underground* (1864), written in the embittered voice of the anonymous ""underground man"", was called by Walter Kaufmann the ""best overture for existentialism ever written."" A prominent figure in world literature, Dostoyevsky is often acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest psychologists in world literature. ([Source][2])

When she was two years old, her family moved to England. She was a ""rebel"" at school, but managed to attend the University of Sussex. She worked in BBC radio for two years before attending the University of Edinburgh, where she earned her doctorate in 18th-century literature, and she was named Alumna of the Year 2009. She has taught at the University of Durham, University of Teesside, and the Open University, and was made a Fellow of Kingston University in 1994. 

Philippa wrote her first novel Wideacre while completing her a PhD, and living in a cottage on the Pennine Way with first husband Peter Chislett, editor of the Hartlepool Mail, and their baby daughter, Victoria. They divorced before the book was published. Following the success of Wideacre and the publication of The Favoured Child, she moved south to near Midhurst, West Sussex, where the Wideacre trilogy was set. Here she married her second husband Paul Carter, with whom she has a son. She divorced for a second time and married Anthony Mason, who she had first met during her time in Hartlepool. She was an established historian and writer when she discovered her interest in the Tudor period and wrote the novel The Other Boleyn Girl which was made into a tv drama, and a major film. Her love for history and commitment to historical accuracy are the hallmarks of her writing. She also reviews for the Washington Post, the LA Times, and for UK newspapers, and is a regular broadcaster on television, radio, and webcasts. 

Philippa now lives on a 100-acre (0.40 km2) farm in the North York Moors national park, with her husband, children and stepchildren (six in all). In her Yorkshire farm, she keeps horses, hens and ducks. Her interests include riding, walking, skiing, and gardening. Her other great interest is the charity that she founded nearly twenty years ago: Gardens for The Gambia. She has raised funds and paid for almost 200 in the primary schools of this very dry and poor African country, and thousands of school children have been able to learn market gardening in the school gardens watered by the wells.

0,['Cordwainer Bird'],"Harlan Ellison was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of a Jewish-American family.  His family moved to Painesville, Ohio, but returned to Cleveland in 1949 after the death of his father.  As a child, he performed in minstrel shows, and frequently ran away from home, taking odd jobs.  He attended Ohio State University but was expelled after 18 months for hitting a professor who had denigrated his writing ability.  He moved to New York City in 1955 to become a science fiction writer.  Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles.  In 1957, he joined a street gang in Brooklyn as research for his novel Web of the City/Rumble and short story collection The Deadly Streets.  In the late 1950s, he wrote erotic fiction under the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird.  Later, he used the pseudonym for works that he felt were warped beyond his original intention by editors or producers.

He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1957 and returned to New York in 1960, before moving to Chicago, to write for Rogue magazine and work as an editor for Regency Books.  In 1962, he moved to California and began writing for Hollywood film studios in.  His first screenplay was for the film The Oscar.  He also wrote scripts for television shows such as The Flying Nun, Burke's Law, Route 66, The Outer Limits, Star Trek, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and Cimarron Strip.  
During the late 1960s, he also wrote a column about political and social issues in television for the Los Angeles Free Press titled ""The Glass Teat.""

Ellison has won ten Hugo Awards, four Nebula Awards, and five Bram Stoker Awards (presented by the Horror Writers Association) including the Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996.  He has written nine novels, hundreds of short stories, and many articles and essays.  He continues to write from his home in Los Angeles, California with Susan, his fifth wife.",,,27 May 1934,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,Harlan Jay Ellison,/authors/OL200394A,/type/datetime,2013-11-26T20:18:43.016059,7.0,,"Los Angeles, CA",,Harlan Ellison,Harlan Ellison,,[5540989],7,,,,/type/author,http://harlanellison.com/home.htm,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_ellison,1934-05-27 00:00:00,,83.0

Kasey has received four coveted Starred Reviews from Publishers Weekly. She is a recipient of the RITA, a Waldenbooks and Bookrak Bestseller award, and many awards from Romantic Times magazine, including a Career Achievement award for her Regency era historical romances. She is an Honor Roll author in Romance Writers of America, Inc. (RWA) 
Kasey has appeared on the TODAY show, and was the subject of a Lifetime Cable TV show ""A Better Way,"" in conjunction with Good Housekeeping magazine, a program devoted to women and how they have achieved career success in the midst of motherhood (short version: ""with great difficulty"").

A highly praised nonfiction book, written as Kathryn Seidick, ""...OR YOU CAN LET HIM GO,"" details the story of Kasey and her family during the time of her eldest son's first kidney transplant. 

Kasey has written Regency romances, Regency historicals, category books including novellas and continuities and a few series ""launch"" books, and single title contemporaries. She has coped with time travel, ghosts, trilogies, the dark side, the very light side, and just about everything in between. Hers is also the twisted mind behind her ongoing Maggie Kelly mystery series starring a former romance writer turned historical mystery writer whose gorgeous hunk of a fictional hero shows up, live and in color, in her Manhattan living room – to melt her knees, to help her solve murders, and to leave the top off her toothpaste. And, says Kasey, she's just getting started!

0,"['Jacqueline Jill Collins Austin Lerman', 'Jackie Collins']",,/type/text,"Jacqueline Jill ""Jackie"" Collins was born on 4 October 1937 in London, England, UK, daughter of  Elsa Bessant and Joseph William Collins. She is the younger sister of actress Joan Collins. Jackie started writing as a teenager, making up steamy stories her schoolmates paid to devour. Her first book, The World is Full of Married Men, became a sensational bestseller because of its open sexuality and the way it dealt honestly with the double standard. After that came The Stud, Sinners, The Love Killers, The World is Full of Divorced Women, The Bitch, Lovers And Gamblers, Chances, and then the international sensation, Hollywood Wives - a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, which was made into one of ABC's highest-rated miniseries starring Anthony Hopkins and Candice Bergen. The Stud, The World is Full of Married Men, and The Bitch were also filmed - this time for the big screen. And Jackie wrote an original movie, Yesterday's Hero, starring Ian McShane and Suzanne Somers.

Jackie Collins has been called a 'raunchy moralist' by the late director Louis Malle and 'Hollywood's own Marcel Proust' by Vanity Fair magazine. With over 500 million copies of her books sold in more than 40 countries, and with some twenty-eight New York Times bestsellers to her credit, Jackie Collins is one of the world's top-selling novelists. She is known for giving her readers an unrivaled insiders knowledge of Hollywood and the glamorous lives and loves of the rich, famous, and infamous! 'I write about real people in disguise,' she says. 'If anything, my characters are toned down - the truth is much more bizarre.' There have been many imitators, but only Jackie Collins can tell you what really goes on in the fastest lane of all. From Beverly Hills bedrooms to a raunchy prowl along the streets of Hollywood; from glittering rock parties and concerts to stretch limos and themansions of the power brokers - Jackie Collins chronicles the real truth from the inside looking out.

Divorced of Wallace Austin after 4 years, they had a child, Trarcy. In 1965, Jackie married Oscar Lerman, and had Tiffany and Rory.

In 1963, she became a full time writer.[2] She wrote from her home in the south-east England, that she never left, but she meticulously researched her far-flung settings at the local library. She never married, and had no children. She inspired her nephew Jonathan Winspear to write.

Violet said: ""The real aim of romance is to provide escape and entertainment"", but when in 1970 she commented: ""I get my heroes so that they're lean and hard muscled and mocking and sardonic and tough and tigerish and single, of course. Oh and they've got to be rich and then I make it that they're only cynical and smooth on the surface. But underneath they're well, you know, sort of lost and lonely. In need of love but, when roused, capable of breathtaking passion and potency. Most of my heroes, well all of them really, are like that. They frighten but fascinate. They must be the sort of men who are capable of rape: men it's dangerous to be alone in the room with."" The comment, that they were 'capable of rape' caused a big controversy, uproar and lead to her receiving hate mail.

In 1973, she became a launch author for the new Presents line of category romance novels. Mills & Boon/Harlequin Presents books were more sensual than the previous line, Romance, under which she had been published. She was chosen to be a launch author because she, along with Anne Mather and Anne Hampson were the most popular and prolific of Mills & Boon's British authors.

Considered a legend in the romance community and influenced many authors, including Muriel Jensen, Jane Porter, Trish Morey and Sandra Marton. She also inspired her nephew Jonathan to write.

Tennyson excelled at penning short lyrics, ""In the valley of Cauteretz"", ""Break, Break, Break"", ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"", ""Tears, Idle Tears"" and ""Crossing the Bar"". Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as Ulysses, although In Memoriam A.H.H. was written to commemorate his best friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and fellow student at Trinity College, Cambridge, who was engaged to Tennyson's sister, but died from a cerebral hemorrhage before they were married. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including Idylls of the King, Ulysses, and Tithonus. During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.

Tennyson wrote a number of phrases that have become commonplaces of the English language, including: ""Nature, red in tooth and claw"", ""'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all"", ""Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die"", ""My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure"", ""Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers"", and ""The old order changeth, yielding place to new"". He is the second most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations after Shakespeare.<sup>[1][1]</sup>

0,"['Stephen; Straub, Peter King', 'Stephen & STRAUB, Peter KING', 'Stephen King And Peter Straub', 'Stephen king']","Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support. After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged.

Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

Stephen made his first professional short story sale (""The Glass Floor"") to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other anthologies.

In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories and to work on novels.",,,"September 21, 1947",,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL2162284A,/type/datetime,2014-03-12T22:50:22.307580,17.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'http://www.stephenking.com', 'title': ""Stephen King's Official Web Site""}]",,,Stephen King,Stephen King,,"[7252554, 7127409, 3367542, 6155621, 6876038]",17,,,,/type/author,,,1947-09-21 00:00:00,,70.0

Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life. After she studied at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she spent a short time at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence. ([Source][1].)

0,['Eva Maria Charlotte Michelle Wiesner Ibbotson'],,/type/text,"Eva Ibbotson (born Maria Charlotte Michelle Wiesner, 1925, Vienna, Austria) was a British novelist specializing in romance and children's fantasy. Eva Ibbotson was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1925. When Hitler came into power, Ibbotson's family moved to England. She attended Bedford College, graduating in 1945; Cambridge University from 1946-47; and the University of Durham, from which she graduated with a diploma in education in 1965. Ibbotson had intended to be a physiologist, but was put off by the amount of animal testing that she would have to do. Instead, she married and raised a family, returning to school to become a teacher in the 1960's. Ibbotson was widowed with three sons and a daughter.

Ibottson began writing with the television drama Linda Came Today, in 1965. Ten years later, she published her first novel, The Great Ghost Rescue. Ibbotson has written numerous books including The Secret of Platform 13, Journey to the River Sea, Which Witch?, Island of the Aunts, and Dial-a-Ghost. She won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize for Journey to the River Sea, and has been a runner up for many of major awards for British children's literature. The books are imaginative and humorous, and most of them feature magical creatures and places, despite the fact that she disliked thinking about the supernatural, and created the characters because she wanted to decrease her readers' fear of such things. Some of the books, particularly Journey to the River Sea, also reflect Ibbotson's love of nature. Ibbotson wrote this book in honor of her husband (who had died just before she wrote it), a former naturalist. The book had been in her head for years before she actually wrote it. Ibbotson said she dislikes ""financial greed and a lust for power"" and often creates antagonists in her books who have these characteristics. Some have been struck by the similarity of ""Platform 9 3/4"" in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books to Ibbotson's The Secret of Platform 13, which came out three years before the first Harry Potter book.

Along with Byron and Shelley, he was one of the key figures in the second generation of the movement, despite publishing his work over only a four year period. During his short life, his work was not well received by critics, but his posthumous influence on poets such as Alfred Tennyson and Wilfred Owen was significant. The poetry of Keats was characterised by sensual imagery, most notably in the series of odes which remain among the most popular poems in English literature. The letters of Keats are among the most celebrated by any English poet. ([Source][1].)

0,"[""Brian O'Nolan"", 'Myles na gCopaleen', ""FLANN O'BRIEN"", ""O'BRIEN FLANN""]",,/type/text,"Brian O'Nolan was an Irish novelist and satirist, best known for his novels At Swim-Two-Birds and The Third Policeman written under the nom de plume Flann O'Brien. He also wrote the novel An Béal Bocht as well as many satirical columns in the Irish Times under the name Myles na gCopaleen. He was born in Strabane, County Tyrone.

Most of O'Nolan's writings were occasional pieces published in periodicals, which explains why his work has only recently come to enjoy the considered attention of literary scholars. O'Nolan was also notorious for his prolific use and creation of pseudonyms for much of his writing, including short stories, essays, and letters to editors, which has rendered a complete cataloging of his writings an almost impossible task—he allegedly would write letters to the Editor of the Irish Times complaining about his own articles published in that newspaper, for example in his regular Cruiskeen Lawn column, which gave rise to rampant speculation as to whether the author of a published letter existed or not. Not surprisingly, little of O'Nolan's pseudonymous activity has been verified.

A key feature of O'Nolan's personal situation was his status as an Irish government civil servant, who, as a result of his father's relatively early death, was obliged to support ten siblings, including an older brother who was an unsuccessful writer. Given the desperate poverty of Ireland in the 1930s to 1960s, a job as a civil servant was considered prestigious, being both secure and pensionable with a reliable cash income in a largely agrarian economy.

The Irish civil service has been, since the Irish Civil War, fairly strictly apolitical: Civil Service Regulations and the service’s internal culture generally prohibit Civil Servants above the level of clerical officer from publicly expressing political views. As a practical matter, this meant that writing in newspapers on current events was, during O'Nolan's career, generally prohibited without departmental permission on an article-by-article, publication-by-publication basis. This fact alone contributed to O'Nolan's use of pseudonyms, though he had started to create character-authors even in his pre-civil service writings.

In reality, that O'Nolan was Flann O'Brien and Myles na gCopaleen was an open secret, largely disregarded by his colleagues, who found his writing very entertaining; this was a function of the makeup of the civil service, which recruited leading graduates by competitive examination—it was an erudite and relatively liberal body in the Ireland of the 1930s to 1970s. Nonetheless, had O'Nolan forced the issue, by using one of his known pseudonyms or his own name for an article that seriously upset politicians, consequences would likely have followed—hence the acute pseudonym problem in attributing his work today.

0,"['Sheila Coates', 'Charlotte Lamb', 'Victoria Wolf', 'Sheila Lancaster']","Sheila Ann Mary Coates was born on 1937 in Essex, England, just before the Second World War in the East End of London. As a child, she was moved from relative to relative to escape the bombings of World War II. 

Sheila attended the Ursuline Convent for Girls. On leaving school at 16, the convent-educated author worked for the Bank of England as a clerk. Sheila continued her education by taking advantage of the B of E's enormous library during her lunch breaks and after work. She later worked as a secretary for the BBC. While there, she met and married Richard Holland, a political reporter. 

A voracious reader of romance novels, she began writing at her husband's suggestion. She wrote her first book in three days with three children underfoot! In between raising her five children (including a set of twins), Charlotte wrote several more novels. She used both her married and maiden names, Sheila Holland and Sheila Coates, before her first novel as Charlotte Lamb, Follow a Stranger, was published by Mills & Boon in 1973. She also used the pennames: Sheila Lancaster, Victoria Wolf and Laura Hardy. 

Sheila was a true revolutionary in the field of romance writing. One of the first writers to explore the boundaries of sexual desire, her novels often reflected the forefront of the ""sexual revolution"" of the 1970s. Her books touched on then-taboo subjects such as child abuse and rape, and she created sexually confident - even dominant - heroines. She was also one of the first to create a modern romantic heroine: independent, imperfect, and perfectly capable of initiating a sexual or romantic relationship. 

A prolific author, Sheila penned more than 160 novels, most of them for Mills & Boon. Known for her swiftness as well as for her skill in writing, Sheila typically wrote a minimum of two thousand words per day, working from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. While she once finished a full-length novel in four days, she herself pegged her average speed at two weeks to complete a full novel. 

Since 1977, Sheila had been living on the Isle of Man as a tax exile with her husband and four of their five children: Michael Holland, Sarah Holland, Jane Holland, Charlotte Holland and David Holland. Sheila passed away on October 8, 2000 in her baronial-style home 'Crogga' on the Island. She is greatly missed by her many fans, and by the romance writing community.",,,22 December 1937,,/type/datetime,2008-04-29T15:03:11.581851,,8 October 2000,Laura Hardy,Sheila Ann Mary Coates Holland,/authors/OL2939318A,/type/datetime,2016-04-18T08:34:37.767992,6.0,,UK,,Sheila Holland,Sheila Ann Mary Coates Holland,,"[5539721, 3373425]",6,,,,/type/author,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Holland,1937-12-22 00:00:00,2000-10-08 00:00:00,63.0

IBSEN', 'Ibsen, Henrik, 1828-1906', 'Ibsen']","Henrik Ibsen was a major 19th-century Norwegian playwright, theatre director, and poet. He is often referred to as ""the god father"" of modern drama and is one of the founders of Modernism in the theatre.[1] His plays were considered scandalous to many of his era, when Victorian values of family life and propriety largely held sway in Europe. Ibsen's work examined the realities that lay behind many facades, possessing a revelatory nature that was disquieting to many contemporaries. It utilized a critical eye and free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. Ibsen is often ranked as one of the truly great playwrights in the European tradition, alongside Shakespeare.

He came from a wealthy municipal family of the equestrian order, and is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.

He introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary (with neologisms such as humanitas, qualitas, quantitas, and essentia) distinguishing himself as a linguist, translator, and philosopher. An impressive orator and successful lawyer, Cicero thought that his political career was his most important achievement. Today, he is appreciated primarily for his humanism and philosophical and political writings. His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. Cornelius Nepos, the 1st-century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters contained such a wealth of detail ""concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government"" that their reader had little need for a history of the period. Cicero's speeches and letters remain some of the most important primary sources that survive on the last days of the Roman Republic.

During the chaotic latter half of the first century B.C. marked by civil wars and the dictatorship of Gaius Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a return to the traditional republican government. However, his career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change. ""Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self-control and adversity with more fortitude!"" wrote C. Asinius Pollio, a contemporary Roman statesman and historian. Cicero became an enemy of Mark Antony, attacking him in a series of speeches. He was proscribed an enemy of the state by the Second Triumvirate and subsequently murdered in 43 BC.

0,"['Colette', 'Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette']","Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette was born in Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye, Yonne, in the Burgundy Region of France.  In 1893 she married Henri Gauthier-Villars, a famous wit known as ""Willy"", who was 15 years her senior.  Her first books, the Claudine series, were published under the pen name of her husband, ""Willy"".  In 1906 she left her husband and lived for a time with the American writer and salonist Natalie Barney.  The two had a short affair, and remained friends until Colette's death.  She then started working in the music halls of Paris with Mathilde de Morny, the Marquise de Belbeuf, with whom she became romantically involved.  In 1907, they performed together in a pantomime entitled Rêve d'Égypte at the Moulin Rouge.  Their onstage kiss nearly caused a riot, which the police were called in to suppress.  As a result of this scandal, further performances of Rêve d'Égypte were banned and Colette and de Morny were no longer able to openly live together, though their relationship continued a total of five years.  She was also involved with the Italian writer Gabriele D'Annunzio during this time.  In 1912 she married Henri de Jouvenel, the editor of the newspaper Le Matin.  She had one daughter.  In 1914, she was asked to write a ballet for the Opéra de Paris, but the composer Maurice Ravel convinced her to rework it into an opera, L'Enfant et les sortilèges, which opened after the war in 1925.  During World War I she converted her husband's estate into a hospital for the wounded.  After the war, her writing career became more successful after the publication of her novel Chéri (1920).  She divorced her husband after having an affair with her stepson.  She married Maurice Goudeket in 1935 and changed her name to Sidonie Goudeket.  Maurice Goudeket published a book about her called Close to Colette: An Intimate Portrait of a Woman of Genius.  She published around 50 novels in total, many with autobiographical elements.",,,28 January 1873,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,3 August 1954,,Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette,/authors/OL119715A,/type/datetime,2016-06-26T05:25:21.352260,5.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/10/17/specials/colette-obit.html', 'title': 'New York Times'}]","Paris, France",,Colette,Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette,,[5541029],5,,,,/type/author,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colette,1873-01-28 00:00:00,1954-08-03 00:00:00,81.0

She studied with the Class of 1962 in the Jefferson High School, Independence, Iowa and she attended Secretarial school in Omaha, Nebraska. 

In 1963, she went to work at the construction firm owned by Bill Dailey, her future husband, who was fifteen years her senior. The two continued to work together, often spending 17 hours a day, seven days a week at work. They worked for 10 years before ""retiring"" to travel around the country in 1974. 

Janet wrote her first novel, ""No Quarter Asked"" in 1974 after her husband, Bill, urged her to back up her claim that she could write a better romance novel than the ones she had read. The book was accepted by Harlequin, making her the category romance giant's first American author. Her 57 novels for Harlequin included one written in every state of the Union, and later became known as ""The Janet Dailey Americana Series."" 

The Daileys were instrumental in forming the Silhouette romance fiction line, for which Janet wrote 12 more titles before entering the mass market field in 1979 with ""Touch the Wind,"" which marked her debut on the New York Times best seller list, where each new title has continued to appear. 

In 1984, Janet entered the mainstream hard cover market with ""Silver Wings, Santiago Blue."" Currently there are over 325 million copies of her novels in print throughout the world, with translations in 19 languages, in 98 countries. 

Since 1980, the Daileys have lived in the ""live music capital of the world,"" Branson, Missouri. In addition to managing Janet's writing career, Bill promotes and produces shows at the Americana Theatre in Branson, Mo.",,,21 May 1944,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,14 Dec 2013,,,/authors/OL21059A,/type/datetime,2014-12-12T23:31:40.447825,10.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'http://www.janetdailey.com/', 'title': 'The Official Janet Dailey Website'}]",,,Janet Dailey,"Dailey, Janet.",,"[6882832, 6425012]",10,,,,/type/author,,,1944-05-21 00:00:00,2013-12-14 00:00:00,69.0

0,"['SHERWOOD ANDERSON', 'Sherwood, Anderson']",,/type/text,"Sherwood Anderson was born in Camden, Ohio on the  13th of September, 1876. He attended school only intermittently, while helping to support his family by working as a newsboy, housepainter, stock handler, and stable groom. At the age of 17 he moved to Chicago where he worked as a warehouse laborer and attended business classes at night. During the Spanish-American war Anderson fought in Cuba and returned after the war to Ohio, for a final year of schooling at Wittenberg College, Springfield.  Anderson's two first novels were Windy McPherson’s Son (1916) and Marching Men (1917), both containing the psychological themes of inner lives of Midwestern villages, the pursuit of success and disillusionment. His third novel, Winesburg, Ohio, was ""half individual tales, half long novel form"", as the author himself described it. It consisted of twenty-three thematically related sketches and stories. Written in a simple, realistic language illuminated by a muted lyricism, Anderson dramatized crucial episodes in the lives of his characters. In 1921 Anderson received the first Dial Award for his contribution to American literature. After traveling extensively in Europe, he returned back to the United States, settling in New Orleans, where he shared an apartment with William Faulkner. From New Orleans Anderson moved to New York for some time, and from there finally to Marion, Virginia, where he built a country house, and worked as a farmer and journalist. In 1927 he bought both of Marion's weekly newspapers, one Republican, one Democrat, and edited them for two years. To earn extra income he continued his series of lectures throughout the country. Commissioned by Today magazine, Anderson studied the labor conditions during the Depression and collected his articles in Puzzled America (1935). Anderson's newspaper pieces were collected in Hello Towns (1929), Return to Winesburg (1967) and The Buck Fever Papers (1971). 
Anderson's best works influenced almost every important American writer of the next generation. He also encouraged William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway in their writing aspirations. Anderson died of peritonitis on an unofficial good-will tour to South America, at Christobal, Canal Zone, on March 8, in 1941.

Mr. Service, who escaped to America from the German invasion of France, later returned to that country where he spent the remainder of his days.

A constant presence at Covent Garden, the pair became close to some of the greatest singers of the era; Amelia Galli-Curci, Rosa Ponselle, Tito Gobbi and Maria Callas. They also came to know the Austrian conductor Clemens Krauss, and it was through he that Cooks learned of the persecution of European Jews. In 1934, Krauss's wife asked the sisters to help a friend to leave Germany. Having accomplished this, the sisters continued the good work, pretending to be eccentric opera fanatics willing to go anywhere to hear a favourite artist. Krauss assisted them, even arranging to perform in cities they needed to visit. The sisters made repeated trips to Germany, bringing back jewellery and valuables belonging to Jewish families. This enabled Jews to satisfy British requirements as regards financial security - Jews were not allowed to leave Germany with their money. Using many techniques of evasion, including re-labelling furs with London labels, the sisters enabled 29 persons to escape from almost certain death.

The Cooks' own finances were little precarious, and when Ida obtained a contract with Mills and Boon to published her first novel in 1936, she left the Civil Service to write full time. As Mary Burchell, she became a prolific writer of romantic fiction. Her great popularity helped the success of Mills and Boon, and guaranteed substantial income after the war. For many decades, her writing supported her two passions: refugees and young opera singers. Her flat in Dolphin Square at various times housed homeless European families.

In 1950, Ida Cook wrote her autobiography: ""We followed our stars"", and in 1965, the Cook sisters were honoured as Righteous Gentiles by the Yad Vashem Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Authority in Israel, thus joining Oskar Schindler among others. She helped to found and was for many years president of the Romantic Novelist's Association. As Mary Burchell, she wrote over a hundred romance novels, many of which were translated, and her most famous work is ""The Warrender Saga"", a series about the opera world, full of real details. She also wrote as James Keene with William Everett Cook.

Her parents were very positive and provided her with a happy childhood. Despite the fact she describes herself as an overweight child it was her parents attitude that gave her the confidence to accept herself for who she is today. 

She studied at University College Dublin and was a teacher for a while. She also loved travelling and this was how she found her niche as a writer. She liked going to all different kinds of places such as a Kibbutz in Israel and worked in a camp in the United States. It was whilst she was away that she sent letters home to her parents. They were so impressed with these chatty letters from all over the world that they decided to send them to a newspaper. They were published. She left teaching and became a journalist. She still writes columns today.

Maeve married Gordon Snell who is also a published writer. When they were struggling financially it was then that Light a Penny Candle was published. She became an overnight success. Her books deal with relationship problems. Many of them are set in the past in Ireland such as ""Echoes"" and often deal with people who are young, fall in love, have families then have relationship or family problems that readers can identify with. The main characters are people you can empathise with. Some of her later novels have been brought forward to the present day to become more modern. Her cousin Dan Binchy is also a published writer.

Narayan (10 October 1906 – 13 May 2001), full name Rasipuram Krishnaswami Iyer Narayanaswami, was an Indian writer, best known for his works set in the fictional South Indian town of Malgudi. He is one of three leading figures of early Indian literature in English (alongside Mulk Raj Anand and Raja Rao), and is credited with bringing the genre to the rest of the world.

Narayan broke through with the help of his mentor and friend, Graham Greene, who was instrumental in getting publishers for Narayan’s first four books, including the semi-autobiographical trilogy of Swami and Friends, The Bachelor of Arts and The English Teacher. Narayan’s works also include The Financial Expert, hailed as one of the most original works of 1951, and Sahitya Akademi Award winner The Guide, which was adapted for film and for Broadway.

Barnard']","Louisa May Alcott was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania on November 29, 1832.  She and her three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and May, were educated by their father, philosopher/ teacher Bronson Alcott, and raised on the practical Christianity of their mother, Abigail May.

Louisa spent her childhood in Boston and in Concord, Massachusetts, where her days were enlightened by visits to Ralph Waldo Emerson’s library, excursions into nature with Henry David Thoreau, and theatricals in the barn at ""Hillside"" (now Hawthorne’s ""Wayside"").

Like her character, ""Jo March"" in Little Women, young Louisa was a tomboy.  ""No boy could be my friend till I had beaten him in a race,"" she claimed, ""and no girl if she refused to climb trees, leap fences ...""

For Louisa, writing was an early passion.  She had a rich imagination and often her stories became melodramas that she and her sisters would act out for friends.  Louisa preferred to play the ""lurid"" parts in these plays --""the villains, ghosts, bandits, and disdainful queens.""

At age 15, troubled by the poverty that plagued her family, she vowed:   ""I will do something by and by.  Don’t care what, teach, sew, act, write, anything to help the family; and I’ll be rich and famous and happy before I die, see if I won’t!""

He is fond of describing his work as ""weird fiction"" (after early 20th century pulp and horror writers such as H. P. Lovecraft), and belongs to a loose group of writers sometimes called New Weird who consciously attempt to move fantasy away from commercial, genre clichés of Tolkien epigones. He is also active in left-wing politics as a member of the Socialist Workers Party. He has stood for the House of Commons for the Socialist Alliance, and published a book on Marxism and international law. He teaches creative writing at Warwick University. ([Wikipedia][1])

He moved with his family to New York early in his childhood. On his 18th birthday, having graduated from high school, he was drafted into the U.S. Army Air Corps, and serves as an armourer, gunnery instructor, truck driver, and military police officer. When the war ended, he became an art student at both the Hunter College in New York City and the Cartoonists and Illustrators School. Upon graduation, he became a freelance graphic artist, providing illustrations for book covers, magazines, and comic books such as Weird Fantasy and Weird Science. He also began contributing articles to these magazines. In 1952, he moved into editing pulp magazines such as Amazing Stories and Fantastic. In 1954 he married, and their first child was born in 1955. In 1956 he became a full-time writer, and began working on his first book in addition to writing for other publications such as The Saint syndicated comic strips. Over the next decade he and his family moved to several places, including Mexico, England, Italy, back to New York for the birth of their second child in 1959, to Denmark for seven years, back to England in 1965, San Diego in 1967, and finally Ireland in 1975 where they settled.

0,['Joan Brady'],,/type/text,"One of seven siblings, Joan grew up on the New Jersey shore. While attending college for her degree in nursing (William Paterson University, Wayne, N.J.), she worked for two summers as one of the state's first female lifeguards.

In 1994, at the age of forty-three, she left her career in nursing to pursue her life-long dream of becoming a writer. Bringing with her a six-year-old, oft-rejected manuscript and only what possessions would fit in the back of her eight-year-old Toyota, she then set out on a solo journey across the country, settling (only by chance) in the completely unfamiliar city of San Diego.

Having never taken a writing class in her life, yet believing in the potential of her manuscript, she signed up for a one-night class at The Learning Annex on ""How to Get Published."" The rest, as they say, is history.

Brady's best selling debut novel, ""God on a Harley"" (Pocket Books, 1995) was translated into seventeen languages around the world and was endorsed by well known self-help experts, Wayne Dyer (""Your Erroneous Zones,"" etc.) and John Gray (""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus""). Film rights to this inspirational story were sold to Mimi Polk Gitlin, co-producer of the classic blockbuster, ""THELMA AND LOUISE.""

Since the success of her first novel, Joan has developed an especially large and loyal following in the Latino community. She has since penned an additional six novels, most of which have become ""best sellers"" in Spain and Latin America.

Today, she is an internationally recognized lecturer and author of seven successful books, she has also contributed numerous articles to professional journals and is frequently asked to speak to a wide variety of groups and organizations. She has been a guest on many television and radio programs here in the United States, as well as in Barcelona, Spain, and in Mexico City, Mexico.",1950,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL77003A,/type/datetime,2012-06-08T00:27:38.330954,5.0,,,,Joan Brady,Joan Brady,,[7133177],5,,,RN.,/type/author,,,1950-04-05 00:00:00,,67.0

0,"['Charlotte Vale Allen', 'Katharine Marlowe']",,/type/text,"Charlotte was born on 19 January 1941 in Toronto, Canada. She was abused during childhood. She moved to England from 1961 to 1964, where she worked as a television actress and singer. She returned to Toronto briefly, performing as a singer and in cabaret revues until she emigrated to the United States in 1966.

In 1970, she married Walter Bateman Allen Jr and instaled in Connecticut in 1970. Shortly after her marriage, she began writing and sold her first novel, Love Life, in 1974. Prior to its publication, she had contracted to do a series of paperback originals for Warner Books, with the result that in 1976 three of her books appeared in print. Her award-winning autobiography, Daddy’s Girl , was actually the first book she wrote, but in 1971 it was deemed too controversial by the editors who read it. It wasn’t until 1980, after she’d gained success as a novelist, that the groundbreaking book was finally published.

Charlotte’s 30-plus novels have sold over eight-million copies, have been published in all English-speaking countries, in braille, and have been translated into more than 20 languages. She is consistently one of the most borrowed authors in worldwide English-language libraries. She also used the pseudonym of Katharine Marlowe.  In 2000, CBS bought the rights to Somebody’s Baby for a movie-of-the-week, and several of her other novels are currently under option for film and television.

In her writing, she tries to deal with issues confronting women, being informative while at the same time offering a measure of optimism. ""My strongest ability as a writer is to make women real, to take you inside their heads and let you know how they feel, and to make you care about them."" Her goal ""has always been to communicate, to enlighten people about women’s issues without being preachy, and to entertain while doing it. If I succeed in getting someone to think about the book’s content after they’ve finished reading it, then I’ve accomplished what I set out to do.""

A film buff and an amateur photographer, Charlotte enjoys foreign travel. She finds cooking and needlework therapeutic, and is a lifelong movie fan. The mother of an adult daughter, she continued living in Connecticut.",19 January 1941,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL282486A,/type/datetime,2012-04-04T18:15:53.159448,6.0,,,,Charlotte Vale Allen,Charlotte Vale Allen,,[7090872],6,,,,/type/author,,,1941-01-19 00:00:00,,76.0

His novels were hugely popular in their day.

Born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, the son of a Unitarian minister, Alger entered Harvard University at the age of 16. Following graduation, he briefly worked in education before touring Europe for almost a year. He then entered the Harvard Divinity School, and, in 1864, took a position at a Unitarian church in Brewster, Massachusetts. Two years later, he resigned following allegations he'd molested two teenage boys. He subsequently retired from the ministry entirely and moved to New York City where he formed an association with the Newsboys Lodging House and other agencies offering aid to impoverished children. His sympathy for the working boys of the city, coupled with the moral values learned at home, were the basis of his many juvenile ""rags to riches"" novels. He died in 1899.<sup>[1][1]</sup>

Brown', 'Sandra/ Brown', 'Brown Sandra']","Sandra Lynn Cox was born on March 12, 1948 in Waco, Texas and raised in Ft. Worth. She is nothing if not serious when it comes to her work. As the oldest of five daughters, she was a responsible and mature girl, and always chose to read a book rather than play with dolls. Her responsible nature stayed with Sandra as she graduated from Texas Christian University with a degree in English, and in her job as a contributing feature reporter at the nationally syndicated PM Magazine in Dallas. When the show experienced mass layoffs, however, Sandra found herself out of work.

Sandra married Michael Brown, former television anchorman and award-winning documentarian of Dust to Dust, and returned to Ft. Worth. They had two children, Rachel and Ryan. Though she continued in her occasional position as a showroom model in Dallas, her husband encouraged her to try fiction writing while their children were at school. He had just left a career as a news anchor and talk-show host to form his own production company, so why shouldn't she take a creative risk, too?

Within a year Sandra sold her first novel, Love's Encore, under the name Rachel Ryan (taken from the first names of her two children). Soon thereafter, she was producing a succession of books for six different publishers, culling ideas from briefs in USA Today, television shows, and her own active imagination. She wrote two boosk as Laura Jordan and several books for Harlequin under the name Erin St. Claire.

Since the publication of her first novel in 1981, she has penned well over sixty books. Sandra has over fifty million copies of her books in print, and has achieved some major feats on what is perhaps the most highly regarded bestseller list of all--that of the New York Times. Since 1990, every one of Sandra's novels has appeared on the list. In total, her books have appeared on the prestigious list over thirty times.

In 1992 her novel ""French Silk"" was made into an ABC-TV movie.",,,12 March 1948,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL1420563A,/type/datetime,2012-06-29T20:13:55.546988,9.0,,,,Sandra Brown,Sandra Brown,,"[7149333, 6457662]",9,,,,/type/author,,,1948-03-12 00:00:00,,69.0

He is widely regarded as one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered a member of the ""Lost Generation"" of the Twenties. He finished four novels, *This Side of Paradise*, *The Beautiful and Damned*, *Tender Is the Night* and his most famous, the celebrated classic, *The Great Gatsby*. A fifth, unfinished novel, *The Love of the Last Tycoon* was published posthumously. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that treat themes of youth and promise along with despair and age.

Often called ""the dean of science fiction writers"", he was one of the most popular, influential, and controversial authors of the genre. He set a high standard for science and engineering plausibility and helped to raise the genre's standards of literary quality. He was one of the first writers to break into mainstream, general magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post, in the late 1940s, with unvarnished science fiction. He was among the first authors of bestselling, novel-length science fiction in the modern, mass-market era. For many years, Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C.

0,"['Catherine Rose Gordon-Cumming Fforde', 'Katie Fforde']","Catherine Rose Gordon-Cumming was born 27 September 1952 in London, England, UK. She studied the arts, cookery, typing, and shorthand. In 1972, Katie married with Desmond Fforde, cousin of the also writer Jasper Fforde. The marriage set up business on the canals. She had three children: Guy, Francis and Briony and didn't start writing before she had the third of them. She has previously worked both as a cleening lady and in a health food cafe.
 
Published since 1995, her romance novels are set in modern-day England.  She is founder of the ""Katie Fforde Bursary"" for writers who have yet to secure a publishing contract. Katie was elected the twenty-fifteenth Chairman (2009-2011) of the Romantic Novelists' Association. She was delighted to have been chosen as Chair of the RNA and says, ""Catherine Jones was a wonderful chair and she's a very tough act to follow. However, I've been a member of the RNA for more years than I can actually remember and will have its very best interests at the core of everything I do."" After Diane Pearson's retirement as RNA's President in 2011, she was elected its fourth president. 
 
Katie lives in Stroud, Gloucestershire, England with her husband, some of her three children and many pets. Recently her old hobbies of ironing and housework have given way to singing, Flamenco dancing and husky racing. She claims this keeps her fit.",,,27 September 1952,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL28879A,/type/datetime,2011-11-23T23:57:19.333223,11.0,,,,Katie Fforde,Katie Fforde,,"[6457332, -1]",11,,,,/type/author,,,1952-09-27 00:00:00,,65.0

0,['Summer Essie'],,/type/text,"Ethel Snelson Summers, well-know as Essie, was born on Bordesley Street in Christchurch, New Zealand on July 24, 1912. Her parents, Ethel Snelson (for whom she was named) and Edwin Summers, had immigrated to New Zealand from England exactly one year earlier. She had an older brother, Edwin and a younger brother, William. She grew up in a warm and happy home where reading and story-telling were highly valued, and from a very early age little Essie was making up her own stories. When a teacher read aloud ""Emily of New Moon"" by L.M. Montgomery, she knew then that she wanted to be a writer. When she was young she had red hair, like many of her heroines, and she has said that she had a very quick temper, which she later learned to control. Essie left school early for financial reasons and began work at Londontown Drapers and she did similar work for the next 13 years, until her marriage. Essie married William Flett, a minister, after a courtship conducted mainly by letters, and they settled into parish life together. They lived in various parts of the North and South Islands of New Zealand though they eventually settled in Hawke's Bay in the North Island. They had two children, William Temple and Elizabeth Lucia, and seven grandchildren. As a minister's wife and a mother, her life was very full, but she was still a prolific writer of short stories, poems and, for a time, a newspaper column. Finally, her husband told her that if she was to achieve her goal of having a novel published by the time she was forty-five, the time to start was now. With his help she was able to concentrate on her writing and had her first novel published the day after her forty-fifth birthday! She went on to become one of the world's most beloved romance writers and a strong supporter of other aspiring writers. When she had achieved some financial security with her writing, she and her husband fulfilled a life-long dream and travelled to Great Britain and parts of Europe, where she was able to visit many of the places where her ancesters had lived. She writes very movingly in her autobiography about seeing the places where her parents had come from and meeting her English relatives. Essie went on to use many of those settings in her novels. In all she wrote fifty-six novels and an autobiography, plus her family history, before her death in Napier at the age of eighty-six on August 27, 1998. She was predeceased by her husband in 1984. Many of her fans have travelled to New Zealand to see for themselves the country that she described so vividly in her books.

Her parents married on 19 February 1890 at the West London Synagogue, her father was a English music critic, author and teacher of singing and her mother was a Australian-born heiress, 16 years younger than him. Denise had a half-sister, Sibyl Klein, who became an actress. She also had two older brothers, Adrian Bernard L. Klein (1892-1969), who later changed his name to Adrian Cornwell-Clyne and wrote books on photography and cinematography, and Daryl Kleyn (b. 1894). During her parents marriage, her mother began an affair with a young Worcestershire Regiment officer, Herbert Arthur Berkeley Dealtry (b. 1878). When her father became aware of it, he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. After the divorce, her mother married Dealtry in 1902, but they were going through financial difficulties. They had to declare bankruptcy in 1905. The same year her father remarried with Helene Fox, a Christian Science practitioner of Boston, Massachusetts. 

As Kit Dealtry, her mother began to publish her own writings, first short stories in magazines an later gothic novels. Years later, and single again her mother returned to London. In 1918, and remarried for a third time with Sydney H. Groom, and started to sign her novels as C. Groom, Mrs Sydney Groom, Kathleen Clarice Groom and Clarice Groom. After Naomi left school, she decided follow in her mother's footsteps, and to publish her writings. She went to work as a journalist for the D.C. Thomson Press, then became a freelance writer. Denise married Arthur Robins, a corn broker on the Baltic Exchange, but the marriage ended in divorce, after she met O'Neill Pearson in Egypt, who later became her second husband. She was the mother of three daughters, Patricia Robins (also know as Claire Lorrimer) who became another best-selling romance author, Anne, and Eve. 

As a writer of fiction, Denise wrote short stories, plays and about 200 gothic romance novels under a variety of pseudonyms, including: Denise Chesterton, Hervey Hamilton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray, and Julia Kane, she also used to sign the books her first married name, Denise Robins, and some of her books were reedited under this pen-name. In 1927, over ten years after she began to publish, Denise meet Charles Boon, of Mills & Boon, and she signed her first contract with his firm the same year. In a short time, she became the best paid Mills & Boon's writer, and one of the most prolific, but in 1935 she changed to a new publisher, Nicholson & Watson, that made her a better offer, and later with Hodder & Stoughton. During her very long career she worked with major publishing houses. Taylor Caldwell said: ""Rarely has any writer of our times delved so deeply into the secret places of a woman's heart."" As in her real life, many of her novels are love triangles, and also appear as a backdrop the World Wars. 

In 1960, she founded with other romance writers the ""Romantic Novelists' Association"" (R.N.A.), and she was its first president until 1966. In 1965, she wrote her autobiography, ""Stranger Than Fiction"". Denise passed away 1 May 1985 in her native England.

Eliot was an American poet, playwright, and literary critic, arguably the most important English-language poet of the 20th century.[3] His first notable publication, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, begun in February 1910 and published in Chicago in June 1915, is regarded as a masterpiece of the modernist movement.[4] It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including Gerontion (1920), The Waste Land (1922), The Hollow Men (1925), Ash Wednesday (1930), Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats (1939), and Four Quartets (1945). He is also known for his seven plays, particularly Murder in the Cathedral (1935) and The Cocktail Party (1949). He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and the Order of Merit in 1948.

Decorated for bravery on the Western Front, he became one of the leading poets of the First World War. His poetry both described the horrors of the trenches, and satirised the patriotic pretensions of those who, in Sassoon's view, were responsible for a jingoism-fuelled war. Sassoon became a focal point for dissent within the armed forces when he made a lone protest against the continuation of the war in his ""Soldier's Declaration"" of 1917, culminating in his admission to a military psychiatric hospital; this resulted in his forming a friendship with Wilfred Owen, who was greatly influenced by him. Sassoon later won acclaim for his prose work, notably his three-volume fictionalised autobiography, collectively known as the ""Sherston trilogy"". - Wikipedia",8 September 1886,initial import,/type/datetime,2008-10-20T17:26:49.483103,,1 September 1967,,,/authors/OL5609281A,/type/datetime,2016-03-10T08:31:05.000251,5.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Sassoon', 'title': 'Wikipedia'}]",,,Siegfried Sassoon,Siegfried Sassoon,,[6715312],5,,,,/type/author,,,1886-09-08 00:00:00,1967-09-01 00:00:00,81.0

The morning that one of her professors asked if she could use samples of Catherine’s creative writing on an overhead projector to teach was a dream come true. In 1988, she sold her first book to Harlequin Intrigue and went on to write three more before she tried her hand at a single-title historical romance. Nine books later, she did her first single-title contemporary.

Catherine married Sidney D. Anderson, an electrical engineer, and they had two sons, Sidney D. Jr. and John G. She lives with her husband, Sid, and her rottweilers, Sam and Sassy, who seem convinced they are teacup poodles and that obedience training is for people.

Dave returned to become Chapel Hill’s Assistant Town Attorney and to try to put his life back together through fiction making sense of his Army experiences.

Dave describes war from where he saw it: the loader’s hatch of a tank in Cambodia. His military experience, combined with his formal education in history and Latin, has made him one of the foremost writers of realistic action SF and fantasy. His bestselling Hammer’s Slammers series is credited with creating the genre of modern Military SF. He often wishes he had a less interesting background.

Grisham', 'Grisham John', 'J GRISHAM', 'Grisham', 'Grisham Iohn.']",,/type/text,"Long before his name became synonymous with the modern legal thriller, he was working 60-70 hours a week at a small Southaven, Mississippi, law practice, squeezing in time before going to the office and during courtroom recesses to work on his hobby—writing his first novel.

Born on February 8, 1955 in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to a construction worker and a homemaker, John Grisham as a child dreamed of being a professional baseball player. Realizing he didn’t have the right stuff for a pro career, he shifted gears and majored in accounting at Mississippi State University. After graduating from law school at Ole Miss in 1981, he went on to practice law for nearly a decade in Southaven, specializing in criminal defense and personal injury litigation. In 1983, he was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1990.

One day at the DeSoto County courthouse, Grisham overheard the harrowing testimony of a twelve-year-old rape victim and was inspired to start a novel exploring what would have happened if the girl’s father had murdered her assailants. Getting up at 5 a.m. every day to get in several hours of writing time before heading off to work, Grisham spent three years on A Time to Kill and finished it in 1987. Initially rejected by many publishers, it was eventually bought by Wynwood Press, who gave it a modest 5,000 copy printing and published it in June 1988.

That might have put an end to Grisham’s hobby. However, he had already begun his next book, and it would quickly turn that hobby into a new full-time career—and spark one of publishing’s greatest success stories. The day after Grisham completed A Time to Kill, he began work on another novel, the story of a hotshot young attorney lured to an apparently perfect law firm that was not what it appeared. When he sold the film rights to The Firm to Paramount Pictures for $600,000, Grisham suddenly became a hot property among publishers, and book rights were bought by Doubleday. Spending 47 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, The Firm became the bestselling novel of 1991.

The successes of The Pelican Brief, which hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and The Client, which debuted at number one, confirmed Grisham’s reputation as the master of the legal thriller. Grisham’s success even renewed interest in A Time to Kill, which was republished in hardcover by Doubleday and then in paperback by Dell. This time around, it was a bestseller.

Since first publishing A Time to Kill in 1988, Grisham has written one novel a year (his other books are The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Chamber, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Partner, The Street Lawyer, The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House, Skipping Christmas, The Summons, The King of Torts, Bleachers, The Last Juror, The Broker, Playing for Pizza, The Appeal, and The Associate) and all of them have become international bestsellers. There are currently over 250 million John Grisham books in print worldwide, which have been translated into 29 languages. Nine of his novels have been turned into films (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, The Chamber, A Painted House, The Runaway Jury, and Skipping Christmas), as was an original screenplay, The Gingerbread Man. The Innocent Man (October 2006) marked his first foray into non-fiction, and Ford County (November 2009) was his first short story collection.

Grisham lives with his wife Renee and their two children Ty and Shea. The family splits their time between their Victorian home on a farm in Mississippi and a plantation near Charlottesville, VA.

Grisham took time off from writing for several months in 1996 to return, after a five-year hiatus, to the courtroom. He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full-time writer: representing the family of a railroad brakeman killed when he was pinned between two cars. Preparing his case with the same passion and dedication as his books’ protagonists, Grisham successfully argued his clients’ case, earning them a jury award of $683,500—the biggest verdict of his career.

When he’s not writing, Grisham devotes time to charitable causes, including most recently his Rebuild The Coast Fund, which raised 8.8 million dollars for Gulf Coast relief in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. He also keeps up with his greatest passion: baseball. The man who dreamed of being a professional baseball player now serves as the local Little League commissioner. The six ballfields he built on his property have played host to over 350 kids on 26 Little League teams.",8 February 1955,,/type/datetime,2010-09-29T06:12:14.102037,,,,,/authors/OL6829207A,/type/datetime,2014-02-19T18:42:16.464949,4.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'http://www.jgrisham.com/bio/', 'title': 'jgrisham.com'}]",,,John Grisham,John Grisham,,"[6771671, 6686989]",4,,,,/type/author,,,1955-02-08 00:00:00,,62.0

As a child he was often sick, especially during the winter months, possibly due to chronic bronchiectasis. He often tutored at home due to his illnesses, but at age eleven he was sent to Edinburgh Academy. He was always interested in writing stories, and his father published his first book, The Pentland Rising: A Page of History, 1666, in 1866.

In 1867 he went to the University of Edinburgh for engineering, although the discipline did not interest him. In 1871, he told his father that he intended to be a writer. His parents convinced him to return to the University of Edinburgh to read Law. After travelling to London and Paris, becoming active in literary circles in both cities, and a physical collapse in 1873 and recovery in the French Riviera, qualified for the Scottish bar in 1875. However, he never practised law, engaging instead in travel and writing.

In the course of his travels, Stevenson met Fanny Vandegrift Osbourne, an American mother of two who was in France to study art, in 1876. They met again in 1877 and became lovers, and he spent much of his time visiting with her and her children in France, until she returned to in San Francisco in 1878.

In 1879 he set sail to the U.S. to join her, becoming sick along the way, and when he arrived in San Francisco he was very ill. The now-divorced Vandegrift came to his bedside and nursed him to recovery. They married in 1880, honeymooned in the Napa Valley of California, then sailed with back to Britain, where he was reunited with his family.

For the next seven years, Stevenson travelled in search of a home that would benefit his health. He spent his summers in Scotland and England and his winters in France. During this time he wrote some of his best known work: Treasure Island (1883), A Child's Garden of Verses (1885), Kidnapped (1886), and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886).

When his father died in 1887, Stevenson moved with his mother and family to the Adirondacks. In 1888, they set sail in a chartered yacht for the South Pacific. For nearly three years they wandered the eastern and central Pacific, visiting the Hawaiian Islands, the Gilbert Islands, Tahiti, New Zealand and the Samoan Islands. They took a second voyage to the Equator in 1889, and a third in 1890 to the South Seas islands.

In 1890 Stevenson purchased some land on one of the Samoan islands and established an estate. He adopted the native name Tusitala, and became involved in local politics, whcih led to clashes with the European bureaucrats who ruled the islands. He died in his estate, probably of cerebral hemorrhage, in 1894.",13 November 1850,initial import,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,3 December 1894,Person,Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson,/authors/OL219525A,/type/datetime,2016-09-19T23:03:47.954410,9.0,,,,Robert Louis Stevenson,Robert Louis Stevenson,,[6257922],9,,,,/type/author,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson,1850-11-13 00:00:00,1894-12-03 00:00:00,44.0

Il colpo di fulmine per l'antico Egitto scoppia subito, e prima dei vent'anni Christian ha già prodotto tutta una serie di poemi e racconti ambientati in quel periodo. Sposato a diciassette anni, va in viaggio di nozze proprio in quelle terre e anche all'università, alla Sorbona, decide di specializzarsi in egittologia, acquisendo presto il dottorato. Dall'inizio degli anni '80 alterna così saggi a volte scientifici ed a volte divulgativi ad opere di fantasia, a romanzi storici. Il successo arriva in Francia nel 1987 e nel resto del mondo un decina d'anni dopo, e permette a Jacq di lasciare Parigi e trasferirsi con la moglie e il cane in una sorta di casa-biblioteca colma di migliaia di volumi, dove dedicarsi ad alcune ambiziose opere in più volumi.

Niet alleen naar vriendjes en vriendinnetjes, maar ook naar de koningin. Tot haar grote verdriet kreeg ze, hoe ze zich ook uitsloofde, nooit een echte brief van hare majesteit terug. Meer dan een voorgedrukt bedankkaartje met de handtekening van de koninklijke secretaresse zat er niet in. Dit weerhield haar er niet van om jaren lang rond 30 april toch weer de pen ter hand te nemen en een brief op de bus te doen naar paleis Soestdijk, waar de toenmalige koningin Juliana, moeder van Beatrix, woonde. 
Na de school voor jounalistiek kwam Margriet bij de radio. Als verslaggever werkte ze voor de actualiteitenrubrieken van verschillende omroepen. 
Margriet Hogeweg woont nu in Utrecht, is getrouwd en heeft twee zonen. 
In 1996 verscheen haar eerste verhaal (De Knoop van Gordium) in de Holle Bolle Gijs, een verzamelbundel van uitgeverij Querido. 
Het boek De God van oma Vanouds werd in 1999 uitgebracht door uitgeverij Lemniscaat. 
In 2001 werd dit boek in het Engels vertaald en verscheen onder de titel The God of Grandma Forever op de Amerikaanse markt. 
Nu is er een nieuw boek: Verboden voor Sinterklaas dat in november in de winkel ligt. Verboden voor Sinterklaas is een verrassend en humoristisch voorleesboek voor kinderen vanaf zeven jaar. Het gaat over Fier die op een dag thuiskomt en zijn moeder en opa ruzie hoort maken. Stiekem blijft hij luisteren. Tot zijn schrik hoort hij dat opa Sinterklaas is en Sinterklaas opa! Eerst is Fier heel boos. Hoe heeft iedereen hem al die tijd zo voor de gek kunnen houden? Maar dan besluit hij zijn opa en zijn moeder een flinke loer te draaien.

His uncle was cold and cruel, and the boarding school he attended, The King's School in Canterbury, was also miserable for him.  At sixteen, he refused to continue at The King's School and he was allowed to travel to Germany, where he studied literature, philosophy and German at Heidelberg University.  In Germany, he wrote his first book, a biography of opera composer Giacomo Meyerbeer, and he met John Ellingham Brooks, with whom he had an affair.

On his return to England he worked in an accountant's office for a month, then returned to Whitstable.  His uncle sent him to King's College London to study medicine, although he had been writing since the age of 20 and intended to become an author.  He continued writing nightly, and in 1897, he finished his second book, Liza of Lambeth.  It was published in 1897, and it became so popular that Maugham, who by this time had qualified to be a doctor, dropped medicine and began writing full-time.  He travelled and wrote, and in 1907 began to experience great success with plays as well as novels.  In World War I he served in France as a member of the British Red Cross's ""Literary Ambulance Drivers.""  During the war he met Frederick Gerald Haxton who became his companion and lover until Haxton's death in 1944.  In 1915, he became a British agent operating in Switzerland against the Berlin Committee while posing as a writer.  In 1916, he and Haxton travelled to the Pacific to research his novel The Moon And Sixpence, based on the life of Paul Gauguin.  In May of 1917, he married Syrie Wellcome, with whom he had had a daughter.  In June of 1917 he went to Russia for the British Secret Intelligence Service, to counter German pacifist propaganda and keep the provisional government in power, a mission which failed.  In 1927-8 he and Syrie divorced.  In 1928 he bought Villa Mauresque in Cap Ferrat on the French Riviera, and made it into a great literary and social salon as well as his home.  In 1940, as France fell to German occupation, he fled to the United States, first to Hollywood, where he became a screenwriter.  He later moved to the South.  When Haxton died in 1944, he returned to England, then in 1946 to his villa in France, where he lived until his death.  Alan Searle became his companion until his death in 1965.",25 January 1874,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,1922,16 December 1965,,William Somerset Maugham,/authors/OL33585A,/type/datetime,2010-10-08T22:39:45.632311,6.0,,"Cap Ferrat, France",,W.

0,,,/type/text,"Margaret Jean Anderson was born in Gorebridge, Scotland, a small mining town where her father was the Presbyterian minister.  She was raised in Lockerbie, Scotland, where her childhood was characterized by freedom to wander through fields and woods close to her family home.  She and her brother and sister caught fish and tadpoles, picked wildflowers, created their own museum of insects and flora, and mapped the nearby marsh.  She studied biology and genetics at Edinburgh University, then worked as a statistician.  She met her husband at a biological research laboratory in Canada, married, and moved to the U.S., settling in Corvalis, Oregon.  After having four children, she took up writing, first writing nonfiction.  She wrote articles for the magazines Ranger Rick and Nature and Science, and a book on insects.  Then she began to write fiction as well, and published several novels before eventually making her way back to nonfiction.  She co-authored three Nature Discovery books with her daughter Karen Stephenson.  She has also written several biographies.",24 December 1931,,,,,,,,/authors/OL528134A,/type/datetime,2010-04-12T13:07:30.520969,4.0,,,,Margaret Jean Anderson,Margaret Jean Anderson,,[5541418],4,,,,/type/author,http://members.peak.org/~mja/index.html,,1931-12-24 00:00:00,,86.0

Perelman, who wanted to be a cartoonist, practiced drawing on cardboard from his father's store. He was a premedical student at Brown University from 1921-1925, where he began publishing cartoons to the campus humor magazine. After graduating from University, he contributed cartoons and essays to the weekly humor magazine Judge. In 1930 he took a job with College Humor. His first book, Dawn Ginsbergh's Revenge, was published in 1929, and Groucho Marx was asked to write a recommendation for the dustjacket. A few years later, Marx hired Perelman as a sceenwriter, and the script was eventually produced as the film Monkey Business. Perelman wrote several more screenplays, collaborating with his wife, Laura Perelman, on all of them he wrote after 1935.

Perelman was at the same time writing regular contributions to The New Yorker, and he left Hollywood for New York in the 1940s, where he continued to write plays and essays. In 1956 he returned to Hollywood for one final film, Around the World in 80 Days. He spent the remainder of his life in New York working on essays and articles, publishing eight more collections before his death. In 1978 he was presented with a special National Book Award for his contribution to American letters.",1 February 1904,,,,,17 October 1979,,Sidney Joseph Perelman,/authors/OL79003A,/type/datetime,2010-04-12T13:20:06.779349,4.0,,"New York, NY",,S.

After graduation, she visited her brother in Kentucky, and was persuaded to try teaching. She began by teaching creative dancing to young children. Later, she moved to Oklahoma where she taught both third grade and dance, and she produced community shows. She then moved to New York and got a job teaching dance to third-graders in a progressive experimental school called the Dalton School in Manhattan.

At this time she also began writing. Her first published book, My Golden Book of Manners, was published in 1961, followed by Let's Be Indians (1962). She created her most famous character with the publication of Amelia Bedelia in 1963. She went on to write 11 more Amelia Bedelia books, as well as other children's books, mystery novels, and arts and crafts books. She also produced television pieces on preschool education and children's books, wrote book review columns and led a number of training workshops for teachers.

Wodehouse', 'Pelham Wodehouse']",,/type/text,"Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, KBE (15 October 1881 – 14 February 1975) (pronounced /ˈwʊdhaʊs/) was an English humorist, whose body of work includes novels, short stories, plays, poems, song lyrics, and numerous pieces of journalism. He enjoyed enormous popular success during a career of more than seventy years and his many writings continue to be widely read. Despite the political and social upheavals that occurred during his life, much of which was spent in France and the United States, Wodehouse's main canvas remained that of pre-war English upper-class society, reflecting his birth, education, and youthful writing career.

An acknowledged master of English prose, Wodehouse has been admired both by contemporaries such as Hilaire Belloc, Evelyn Waugh and Rudyard Kipling and by modern writers such as Stephen Fry, Douglas Adams, Salman Rushdie, Zadie Smith and Terry Pratchett. Journalist and writer Christopher Hitchens commented, ""there is not, and never will be, anything to touch him.""

Wodehouse's characters are often eccentric, with peculiar attachments, such as to pigs (Lord Emsworth), newts (Gussie Fink-Nottle), antique silver (Bertie's Uncle Tom Travers), golf-collectables (numerous characters) or socks (Archibald Mulliner). His ""mentally negligible"" good-natured characters invariably make their lot worse by their half-witted schemes to improve a bad situation.

A key figure in most Wodehouse stories is a ""fixer"" whose genius soars above the incompetent blather and crude bluster of most of the other characters, Jeeves being the best known example. Other characters in this vein are Lord Ickenham (""Uncle Fred"") and Galahad Threepwood, who perform much the same role in the Blandings Castle stories—though never both at the same time—and Psmith, who does the same thing in the stories that bear his name.

Wodehouse was known for his consummate skill at their detailed construction and development. Typically, a relative or friend makes some demand that forces a character into a bizarre situation from which it seems impossible to recover, only to resolve itself in a clever and satisfying finale.

Married with her high school sweetheart Dan Spencer, shortly after her graduation, a decision she calls the wisest choice of her life. They had two daughters, Amy and Beth (d. 1990).

LaVyrle worked as a teacher's aide at Osseo Junior High School, when in her thirties, she read Kathleen Woodiwiss's novel ""The Flame and Flower"", which gave her the idea to become a novelist. She decided to try transferring to paper a recurring dream she was having about a story based on her grandmother's lifestyle on a Minnesota farm. Her story became her first manuscript, ""The Fulfillment"", and she sent it to Kathleen Woodiwiss. The bestselling author read the novel and promptly mailed it to her own editor at Avon. The editor purchased the novel, which was published in 1979. She was inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame in 1988. She wrote 23 sweet historical and contemporany novels. Published around the world, her works had included 12 New York Times Bestsellers, and have been won 4 RITA Awards, 3 Golden Medallion Award and a Minnesota Book Awards. LaVyrle said: ""the trademark of my books is mending relationships, showing people how to mend relationships.""

LaVyrle was a founding member of the Midwest Fiction Writers (MFW), chapter 24 of the Romance Writers of America. Four of LaVyrle's novels was produced as television movies: The Fulfillment in 1989 (She and her husband appear as extras in the film), Morning Glory in 1993, Home Song in 1996 and Family Blessings in 1999.

LaVyrle and her husband are grandparents. Her husband was a retired estimator for a general contractor, and she also decided to retire from writing in 1997, after an 18 year career.

Thoreau', 'Henry David Dillman,  Richard Thoreau', 'Thoreau & Emerson']","Henry David Thoreau (born David Henry Thoreau) was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.

Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry total over 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions were his writings on natural history and philosophy, where he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close natural observation, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore; while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and ""Yankee"" love of practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time imploring one to abandon waste and illusion in order to discover life's true essential needs.

The characters in most of her books all belong to one of three extended families (Macleod, McKinnon, de Piaget) and her love scenes are not as explicit as many other popular romances.

Her first attempts at writing came when she was five years old and living in Hawaii. Her series of short stories featured a young man who encountered all sorts of trouble. After she moved to the mainland U.S. a short time later, she put aside her interest in writing to focus on music. Kurland always loved to read, though, and in college was introduced to romance novels. She soon decided to write her own novel. Stardust of Yesterday was published in 1996, winning two RITA awards. To date, she has published twenty-nine full-length novels and eight novellas, one of which won a RITA.

Zola's style was called literary naturalism; his novels were attacked and even banned for their frankness and sordid detail, and caused quite a bit of controversy in their day. The same traits made him a best-selling author and a star of French literature in his day. In 1898 he then further incurred the wrath of French officials when he published the open letter ""J'Accuse,"" in defense of Alfred Dreyfus, an Army officer who had been convicted of treason. Zola was sentenced to prison for libel, fled to England, and was granted amnesty a few months later. He died in Paris from carbon monoxide poisoning -- the victim of a stopped-up chimney -- a few months before Dreyfus was officially exonerated.

0,"['Georgette Heyer Rougier', 'Georgette Heyer', 'Stella Martin']","Georgette Heyer was born on 16 August 1902 in Wimbledon, London, England, UK. She was the eldest child of Sylvia Watkins and George Heyer; her brother George Boris was born four years later, and her brother Frank nine years later. During her childhood, the family lived also in Paris, France, but they returned to England before World War I. During the war, her father served as a requisitions officer for the British Army in France. Encouraged by her father to read, he never forbade her any book. At 17, she began a serial story to amuse her brother Boris, who suffered from a form of haemophilia and was often weak. Her father enjoyed listening to her story and asked her to prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and ""The Black Moth"" was released in 1921.

In December 1920, she met George Ronald Rougier, a young two years older than her, who studied at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. They became engaged the spring of 1925, and she had five novels published. Only one month later, her father died of a heart attack, and he left no pension for his family. She assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. On 18 August 1925, Georgette married George Ronald, but two moths later, he was sent to Caucasus Mountains, and she remained at home and continued to write. She released ""These Old Shades"", during the midst of the UK General Strike of 1926; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. The novel sold 190,000 copies, and she refused for the rest of her life to promote her novels. Her husband was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika, and she joined him in 1927, they moved to Macedonia in 1928, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family, and the following year they returned to England.

In England, her husband started diferent business, but she was always the primary breadwinner. They had a son, Richard, and she continued to care for her brothers and mother. During the World War II, her husband and brothers served in the army, and to earn more money, she reviewed books for Heinemann. To minimize her tax liability, she formed a limited liability company, that paid salaries for her and her family. The tax inspectors discovered financial problems with the company, which she finally sold. She wrote principally historical romance novels and some detective novels. She essentially established the historical sub-genre of Regency romance, inspired by Jane Austen's work. Unlike Austen, who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, she was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, she collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life, becoming an expert. Her successful regency novels were imitated by many authors like Barbara Cartland, and in some cases were allegedly plagiarized, but she chose not to file lawsuits. She continued writing until her death by lung cancer on 4 July 1974; her novel My Lord John, the first and only book of the Lancaster Trilogy, was published posthumously.",,,16 August 1902,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,4 July 1974,,,/authors/OL766555A,/type/datetime,2014-10-13T22:10:08.259821,15.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'http://www.georgette-heyer.com/', 'title': 'The Definitive Fan Website for Georgette Heyer'}]",,,Georgette Heyer,Georgette Heyer,,"[7304577, 6892272, 6709810, 6892277, 6892275, -1]",15,,,,/type/author,,,1902-08-16 00:00:00,1974-07-04 00:00:00,72.0

In 1937 he obtained a B.A. in English at Paine College and in 1938 he got an M.A. in English at Fisk University. After university, he taught English at Florida A. & M. College (now Florida A. & M. University) in Tallahassee, Florida for one term and then moved to Southern University in Baton Rouge, LA, where he taught for another year. He disliked teaching and moved instead to Detroit, Michigan, to work for the Ford Motor Co., which gave him time for writing. His first book, The Foxes of Harrow (1946), was a romance novel set in the Antebellum South. Although it became a best-seller (making him the first African-American to produce a best-seller in the U.S.) and went on to become a 20th Century Fox film called ""Foxes"", he was criticized for showing a lack of racial consciousness in his work. Critics called The Foxes of Harrow another ""Gone With The Wind."" Although he objected to this criticism, his novels of the 1950s and 1960s began to address issues of race.

0,"['Jean Marie Untinen Auel', 'Jean M. Auel']",,/type/text,"Jean Marie Untinen was born on February 18, 1936 in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.. She was the second of five children, her father was a housepainter, Neil Solomon Untinen, and her mother Martha Wirtanen.
After High School, Jean M. married with Ray Bernard Auel (surname pronounced like ""owl""), and raised five children of her own. The marriage live in Portland, Oregon. 
In 1964, Jean M. became a member of Mensa. She attended Night school while working: she worked as a clerk (1965-1966), a circuit board designer (1966-1973), technical writer (1973-1974), and a credit manager at Tektronix (1974-1976). In 1976, finally she earned her M.B.A. for the Portland State University and has received honorary degrees from the University of Maine and Mount Vernon College for Women.
Three months later Jean M. still hadn't found a new job that suited her. About that time she got an idea for a short story about a prehistoric girl. She says: ""The 'short story' led me to do some research; the research fired my imagination, and the wealth of material made me decide to write a novel. The first draft turned out to be more than 450,000 words and fell into six parts. On rewriting, I realized each of these six parts was a novel in itself. I have used that rough draft as the outline for the series."" 
In 1977, Jean M. began extensive library research of the Ice Age for her first book in Earth's Children Series. She joined a survival class to learn how to construct an ice cave, and learned primitive methods of making fire, tanning leather, and knapping stone from aboriginal skills expert Jim Riggs, who Jean M. describes as ""the kind of person you could put into one end of a wilderness naked, and he'd come out the other end fed, clothed, and sheltered."" 
Jean M. proceeded with work on the first novel. She rewrote the whole thing four times and some parts twenty to thirty times until she was satisfied with the end result. This was in September 1978. She had a hard time finding a publisher to take on the series, given the large task ahead - with five more novels pending. In September 1980 when ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" as Jean M. Auel, finally saw the light of day it was an instant success. Within a month more than 100,000 copies sold, after which it was on the best-seller lists for eight more months. 
After the success of the first book, Jean M. was able to travel to prehistoric sites and to meet many of the experts with whom she had been corresponding. Her research has taken her across the Old Europe from Spain to Ukraine. She has appreciated Atapuerca's discoveries and she has developed a close friendship with the french Dr. Jean Clottes, who was responsible for, among many other things, the exploration of the Cosquer Cave discovered in 1985 and the Chauvet Cave discovered in 1994. 
For they future Jean M. says: ""I've been working 17 years on this project, and I want to do something else--maybe a mystery, or a thin little literary science fiction book, or something. But, I admit, I've learned a lot. I love the research. I can't think of anything more fun than learning anything I want and earning a living writing about it the way I want to.""",18 February 1936,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,"Untinen Auel, Jean Marie",/authors/OL402869A,/type/datetime,2012-02-21T20:43:34.117099,8.0,,"USA, Illinois, Chicago",,Jean M.

She attended the Cincinnati Academy of Fine Arts in Ohio from 1938 through 1942. Her marriage to Willson Stamper ended in divorce in 1959. Ms. Alexander, the creator of so many humorous children in literature, is the mother of two—a girl, Kim, and a boy, Allen.                                                               
Martha Alexander is the embodiment of the person who marches to the beat of a different drummer.
It is this same determination that has made her so successful in publishing. Her first published illustrative work was not for children, but for adults, drawing cosmetics for magazines. When she made the discovery that she was not going to get rich by drawing makeup, she decided she may as well draw something she would like to. And if she became rich in the process, so much the better. Her economic status aside, Martha has decidedly enriched the children's book field with her characteristically small-format books such as the *Blackboard Bear* series, among others.

She was the youngest of three children, and she adds that her parents still live in the house where she first came into the world, and her two brothers live very close by. 

Carole's early ambition to become a nurse came to an abrupt end after only one year of training due to a weakness in her back, suffered in the aftermath of a fall. Instead, she went on to work in the computer department of a well-known stationery company. During her time there, Carole made her first attempt at writing a novel for Mills and Boon. ""The manuscript was far too short and the plotline not up to standard, so I naturally received a rejection slip,"" she says. ""Not taking rejection well, I went off in a sulk for two years before deciding to 'have another go.'"" Her second manuscript was accepted, beginning a long and fruitful career. Her strong, traditional romances, with their distinct style, brilliantly developed characters and romantic plot twists, have earned her an enthusiastic audience worldwide. Since the publication of her first novel in 1978, this British writer has shown no signs of slowing her pace. In fact, when over 20 years later she celebrated the publication of her 100th book She says: ""I have enjoyed every moment of my career!

B. Poquelin Molière', '1622-1673 Molière']",,/type/text,"Molière (Jean-Baptiste Poquelin) was born in Paris on January 15, 1622. His father was one of eight valets de chambre tapissiers who tended the king's furniture and upholstery, so the young Poquelin received every advantage a boy could wish for. He was educated at the finest schools (the College de Clermont in Paris.) He had access to the king's court. But even as a child, Molière found it infinitely more pleasant to poke fun at the aristocracy than to associate with them. As a young boy, he learned that he could cause quite a stir by mimicking his mother's priest. His mother, a deeply religious woman, might have broken the young satirist of this habit had she not died before he was yet twelve-years-old. His father soon remarried, but in less than three years, this wife also passed away. At the age of fifteen, Jean-Baptiste was left alone with his father and was most likely apprenticed to his trade.

The boy never showed much of an interest for the business of upholstering. Fortunately, his father's shop was located near two important theatrical sites: the Pont-Neuf and the Hôtel de Bourgogne. At the Pont-Neuf, comedians performed plays and farces in the street in order to sell patent medicines to the crowds. Although not traditional theatre in the strictest sense, the antics of these comic medicine-men brought a smile to Jean-Baptiste's face on many an afternoon. At the Hôtel de Bourgogne--which the boy attended with his grandfather--the King's Players performed more traditional romantic tragedies and broad farces. Apparently, these two theatrical venues had quite an impact on the young Poquelin, for in 1643, at the age of twenty-one, he decided to dedicate his life to the theatre.

Jean-Baptiste had fallen in love with a beautiful red-headed actress named Madeleine Béjart. Along with Madeleine, her brother Joseph and sister Genevieve, and about a dozen other young well-to-do hopefuls, Jean-Baptiste founded a dramatic troupe called The Illustrious Theater. It was about this time that he changed his name to Molière, probably to spare his father the embarrassment of having an actor in the family.

Molière and his companions made their dramatic debut in a converted tennis court. Although the company was brimming with enthusiasm, none of them had much experience and when they began to charge admission, the results proved disastrous. Over the course of the next two years, the little company appeared in three different theatres in various parts of Paris, and each time, they failed miserably. Several of the original members dropped out of the company during this period. Finally, the seven remaining actors decided to forget Paris and go on a tour of the provinces. For the next twelve years, they would travel from town to town, performing and honing their craft.

It was during this period that Molière began to write plays for the company. His first important piece, L'Étourdi or The Blunderer, followed the escapades of Mascarille, a shrewd servant who sets about furthering his master's love affair with a young woman only to have his plans thwarted when the blundering lover inadvertantly interferes. The five-act piece proved quite successful, and a number of other works followed. By the spring of 1658, Molière and his much-improved company decided to try their luck once more in Paris. When they learned that the King's brother, the Duke of Anjou, was said to be interested in supporting a dramatic company which would bear his name, they immediately set about gaining an introduction to the Court.

On the evening of October 24, 1658, Molière and his troupe performed for the first time before Louis XIV and his courtiers in the Guard Room of the old Louvre Palace. They made a crucial mistake, however, by performing a tragedy (Cornielle's second-rate Nicoméde) instead of one of their popular farces. The Court was not impressed. Fortunately Molière, realizing their blunder, approached the King at the conclusion of the tragedy and asked permission to perform one of his own plays, The Love-Sick Doctor. The King granted his request, and the play was such a success that the little company--which would thereafter be known as the Troupe de Monsieur--was granted use of the Hôtel du Petit Bourbon, one of the three most important theaters in Paris.

The first of Molière's plays to be presented at the Petit Bourbon was Les Précieuses Ridicules or The Pretentious Ladies which satirized Madame de Rambouillet, a member of the King's court who had set herself up as the final judge of taste and culture in Paris. The play proved so successful that Molière doubled the price of admission and was invited to give a special performance for the King. The King was delighted and rewarded the playwright with a large gift of cash, but Molière had made powerful enemies of some of the King's followers. Madame de Rambouillet and her coterie managed to have performances of the play suspended for fourteen days and, in an attempt to drive Molière from the city, eventually managed to have the Petit Bourbon closed down completely. But the King immediately granted Molière use of the Théâtre du Palais Royal where he would continue to perform for the rest of his life.

Over the course of the next thirteen years, Molière worked feverishly to make his company the most respected dramatic troupe in Paris. (Eventually, they were awarded the coveted title ""Troupe of the King."") He directed his own plays and often played the leading role himself.

On February 17, 1673, Molière suffered a hemorrhage while playing the role of the hypochondriac Argan in The Imaginary Invalid. He had insisted on going through with the performance in spite of the advice of his wife and friends saying, ""There are fifty poor workers who have only their daily wage to live on. What will become of them if the performance does not take place?"" He passed away later that night at his home on the Rue Richelieu. The local priests refused to take his confession, for actors had no social standing and had been excommunicated by the church. Nor would they permit him to be buried in holy ground. Four days later, the King interceded and Molière was finally buried in the Cemetery Saint Joseph under the cover of darkness.

Molière left behind a body of work which not only changed the face of French classical comedy, but has gone on to influence the work of other dramatists the world over. The greatest of his plays include The School for Husbands (1661), The School for Wives (1662), The Misanthrope (1666), The Doctor in Spite of Himself (1666), Tartuffe (1664,1667,1669), The Miser (1668), and The Imaginary Invalid (1673).

[Comment by Tricia Sullivan, on The Guardian][1]:
Octavia E Butler (1947–2006)

> I was teaching in New York when I came across Octavia E Butler's Kindred in a secondary-school catalogue of novels recommended to support diversity. It caught my attention because Butler was described as a science-fiction writer. I thought I was familiar with science fiction, but I'd never heard of her – nor have a great many other readers, I suspect. For many years, Butler was the sole African-American woman novelist in science fiction. Kindred tells the wrenching and unforgettable story of a young black woman who time-travels and saves the life of her slaveholder ancestor, but it is, in Butler's words, ""a grim fantasy"", not science fiction.

> Beginning in the 1970s, Butler wrote three sequences of novels: the Patternist books, the Lilith's Brood series and the Parable novels (incomplete at her tragic death in 2006). Critically respected, she won the Hugo and Nebula awards, received a Clarke nomination, the PEN lifetime achievement award and a MacArthur Foundation ""genius"" grant. A serious writer working in a field that is seldom taken seriously, Butler addressed biological control, gender, humanity's relationship with aliens, genetics and even the development of a fictional religion. Her narratives leave space for the reader's involvement while exploring the nature of change. They gaze unflinchingly on power dynamics. ""Who will rule? Who will lead? Who will define, refine, confine, design? Who will dominate? All struggles are essentially power struggles,"" Butler stated, ""and most are no more intellectual than two rams knocking their heads together."" Butler's writing is courageous, stimulating and infused with a rare purity of intention. Crushingly, she died at the height of her powers. [Bloodchild and Other Stories][2] is a good place to begin discovering her work.

Gorey is typically described as an illustrator. His books can be found in the humor and cartoon sections of major bookstores, but books like The Object Lesson have earned serious critical respect as works of surrealist art. His experimentations — creating books that were wordless, books that were literally matchbox-sized, pop-up books, books entirely populated by inanimate objects — complicates matters still further. As Gorey told Richard Dyer of The Boston Globe, ""Ideally, if anything [was] any good, it would be indescribable."" Gorey classified his own work as literary nonsense, the genre made most famous by Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. (Source: Wikipedia.)",,,"ca.

He was orphaned at an early age and raised in central California. He worked as a cowhand in the San Joaquin Valley, then went on to attend the University of California at Berkeley. He did not finish university, but did begin to write while there. After leaving university, he traveled, spent a year in the Canadian army, and then moved to New York City in 1916. He began writing for pulp magazines. In 1934 he started placing his fiction in slick magazines, and in 1938 he and his family moved to Hollywood, California, where he wrote film scripts for several studios. When World War II began he became a war correspondent. He died of shrapnel injuries during the war.

Over the course of his life Faust wrote more than 500 novels for magazines and almost that many short stories as well.

Voltaire was a prolific writer and produced works in almost every literary form including plays, poetry, novels, essays, historical and scientific works, more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets. He was an outspoken supporter of social reform, despite strict censorship laws and harsh penalties for those who broke them. As a satirical polemicist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma and the French institutions of his day.

Voltaire was one of several Enlightenment figures (along with Montesquieu, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau) whose works and ideas influenced important thinkers of both the American and French Revolutions. ([Source][1])

At the time of his death at the age of 57, he was being cited by many literary critics as one of the greatest living authors and had been tipped as a possible future winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature.

0,['Judy Blume'],"Judy Blume (born Judith Sussman) is an American author. She has written many novels for children and young adults which have exceeded sales of 80 million and been translated into 31 languages. Blume's novels for teenagers were among the first to tackle such controversial matters as racism (*Iggie's House*), menstruation (*Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.*), divorce (*It's Not the End of the World, Just As Long As We're Together*), bullying (*Blubber*), masturbation (*Deenie; Then Again, Maybe I Won't*) and teen sex (*Forever*), and as such have been the source of controversy over the appropriateness of such topics for her middle school audience. She is married with two children and a stepchild.

Scott has been said to be particularly associated with Toryism, though several passages in Tales of a Grandfather display a liberal, progressive and Unionist outlook on Scotland's history.

Scott was the first English-language author to have a truly international career in his lifetime, with many contemporary readers in Europe, Australia, and North America. His novels and poetry are still read, and many of his works remain classics of both English-language literature and of Scottish literature. Famous titles include Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, The Lady of The Lake, Waverley, The Heart of Midlothian and The Bride of Lammermoor.

He contributed to the modernist avant-garde and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century.

Joyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer's Odyssey are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles, perhaps most prominent among these the stream of consciousness technique he utilised. Other well-known works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, occasional journalism and his published letters. [(Wikipedia][1])

She graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor's degree in Society and Law. Before becoming a full-time writer, she worked as a bartender, a computer consultant, and an insurance specialist.

She began her career writing paranormal romance set in Scotland but as she became increasingly fascinated with Celtic mythology, she switched genres to Urban Fantasy and location to Dublin, Ireland, so she could focus on the Tuatha de Danann, or Fae--an ancient race of immortal beings who have lived secretly among humans for millennia. A Rita-award winning novelist, she is the author of the Highlander novels and the internationally bestselling urban fantasy Fever series. Her books have been published in twenty-four languages, and her events draw fans from all over the world.

He is a skilled rider and has worked as a summer camp horse wrangler and performed in front of large audiences in both drill riding and stunt riding exhibitions.

Jim enjoys fencing, singing, bad science fiction movies and live-action gaming. He lives in Missouri with his wife, son, and a vicious guard dog.

Jim goes by the moniker Longshot in a number of online locales. He came by this name in the early 1990′s when he decided he would become a published author. Usually only 3 in 1000 who make such an attempt actually manage to become published; of those, only 1 in 10 make enough money to call it a living. The sale of a second series was the breakthrough that let him beat the long odds against attaining a career as a novelist.

All the same, he refuses to change his nickname.""

Born in Náchod, Czechoslovakia, Škvorecký graduated in 1943 from the Reálné gymnasium in his native Náchod. For two years during the Second World War he was a slave labourer in a German aircraft factory.

After the war, he began to study at the Faculty of Medicine of Charles University in Prague, but after his first term he moved to the Faculty of Arts, where he studied Philosophy and graduated in 1949.[2] In 1951 he gained a Ph.D. in Philosophy. Between 1952 and 1954, he performed his military service in the Czechoslovak army.

He worked briefly as a teacher, editor and translator during the 1950s. During this period he completed several novels including his first novel The Cowards (written 1948-49, published 1958[3]) and The End of the Nylon Age (1956).[4] They were condemned and banned by the Communist authorities after their publication. His prose style, open-ended and improvisational, was an innovation, but this and his democratic ideals were a challenge to the Communist regime. Škvorecký kept writing, and helped nurture the democratic movement that culminated in the Prague Spring in 1968.

After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that year, Škvorecký and his wife, writer and actress Zdena Salivarová, fled to Canada.

In 1971, he and his wife founded 68 Publishers which, over the next twenty years, published banned Czech and Slovak books.> The imprint became an important mouthpiece for dissident writers, such as Václav Havel, Milan Kundera, and Ludvík Vaculík, among many others.> For providing this critical literary outlet, the president of post-Communist Czechoslovakia, Václav Havel, later awarded the couple the Order of the White Lion in 1990.

He taught at the Department of English at the University of Toronto where he was eventually appointed Professor Emeritus of English and Film. He retired in 1990. (In Canada, he is considered to be a Canadian author despite the fact that he is still mostly publishing in Czech.)

**Literary Work**

Most of Škvorecký’s novels are available in English: the novels The Cowards, Miss Silver's Past, The Republic of Whores, The Miracle Game, The Swell Season, The Engineer of Human Souls which won the Canadian Governor General's Award, The Bride of Texas, Dvorak in Love, The Tenor Saxophonist's Story, Two Murders in My Double Life, An Inexplicable Story or The Narrative of Questus Firmus Siculus, his selected short stories When Eve Was Naked and the two short novels The Bass Saxophone and Emöke. A recurring character in several of his novels is Danny Smiricky, who is a partial self-portrait of the author.

He wrote four detective novels featuring Lieutenant Boruvka of the Prague Homicide Bureau: The Mournful Demeanor of Lieutenant Boruvka, Sins for Father Knox, The End of Lieutenant Boruvka and The Return of Lieutenant Boruvka.
His poetry was published as a collection in 1999 as ...there's no remedy for this pain (...na tuhle bolest nejsou prášky).

His non-fiction works include Talkin' Moscow Blues, a book of essays on jazz, literature and politics, an autobiography Headed for the Blues, and two books on the Czech cinema including All the Bright Young Men and Women.

Škvorecký wrote for films and television. The feature film The Tank Battalion was adapted from his novel The Republic of Whores. Other features, written for Prague TV, include Eine kleine Jazzmusik, adapted from his story of the same name, The Emöke Legend from a novella of the same name, and a two-hour TV drama Poe and the Murder of a Beautiful Girl, based on Edgar Allan Poe's story The Mystery of Marie Roget. Three very successful TV serials were made from his stories: Sins for Father Knox, The Swell Season and Murders for Luck.

In the shadow of the above-mentioned lies a forgotten but unique and brilliant film Pastor's End, based on the novel of the same name. Based on a true story, the movie produced in 1968 never saw the light of day and went straight into locked Communist archives due to the fact that its author ""illegally"" fled the country.
Prominent in his writing for radio was a long-running monthly series on literature for Voice of America. From 1973-1990 he wrote over 200 of these shows covering notable literary works and discussing literary themes.
He died in 2012 of cancer in Toronto.",1924,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,2012,,,/authors/OL75593A,/type/datetime,2012-07-01T18:49:35.150192,8.0,,,,Josef Škvorecký,Josef Škvorecký,,"[7149780, 7149779, 7149777, 7149767]",8,,,,/type/author,,,1924-04-05 00:00:00,2012-04-05 00:00:00,88.0

Woodiwiss and she immediately knew that she too could write one. She submitted her first manuscript to an editor at Avon Books and told her a little about herself and a little about the book. She asked her to pop it in the mail, and when she read it, she bought it. Her novel, The Irish Gypsy, was published in 1982.

Virginia Henley is a New York Times bestselling writer of historical novels. Her work has been translated into fourteen languages. She is the recipient of more than a dozen writing awards, including a Romantic Times Lifetime Achievement Award, a Waldenbooks' Bestselling Award, and a Maggie Award for Excellence from the Georgia Romance Writers.

0,,,/type/text,"Elizabeth Bailey grew up in Africa, where her father worked in the then British colony of Nyasaland (now Malawi). It was a great place for children, with tropical weather and wide-open spaces. One of four siblings from parents who were regarded as a trifle unconventional, she was encouraged to develop an interest in reading and drama from an early age. A love of romance was born first through fairy tales and then Georgette Heyer, whom Elizabeth discovered at the age of 11. Instantly hooked, she still enjoys a Heyer for relaxation. Her first kiss was classically romantic — on board ship under the stars — and she still recalls feeling her legs turning to jelly. 

Returning to England after a short period as a secretary (training which has come in useful ever since), Elizabeth went to drama school and trod the boards for some 17 years as an actress. Writing romance was a late development, however. Writing had always been there, as a hobby and a release. She has acres of poetry and half-finished stories from those years. In her 30s, and almost on a whim, Elizabeth began writing historical romance. Within a very short space of time, writing consumed her life and she realized that this was her true métier.A lengthy apprenticeship was at last rewarded with publication by Mills & Boon in the early '90s and Elizabeth has never looked back. 

In addition to writing historical romance, she taught drama for years and became producer and director of the school's theater company, writing and adapting plays for casts of over 70 students. Now she has given up teaching, but continues her involvement with the school's theater, creating productions twice yearly. She is also artistic director of a local arts festival held annually in August in Sussex, where she lives.",1953,,/type/datetime,2008-09-16T23:33:27.920658,,,,,/authors/OL4760583A,/type/datetime,2012-02-24T23:15:25.955481,4.0,,,,Elizabeth Bailey,Elizabeth Bailey,,[7073147],4,,,,/type/author,,,1953-04-05 00:00:00,,64.0

0,,,/type/text,"Lucy Daniels is a nobody. She doesn't exist. She is a brand, not a person.

The Lucy Daniels story begins with two men: Ben Baglio, an American children's book packager, and Rod Ritchie, managing director of Hodder prior to its merger with Headline. Baglio moved to the UK in the early 90s and had moderate successes with Mystery Club, a kid's crime series, and Mystery Kids, a Grange Hill-type series, both of which have since been dumped by Hodder. But with Lucy Daniels he struck gold. 

The list of Animal Ark authors reads like a Who's Who of children's fiction. Sue Welford, a Whitbread prize nominee, Jenny Oldfield and Helen Magee, all of whom are names in their own right, have done a turn as Lucy Daniels. In Jenny Oldfield's case, she has done dozens of turns, and the reason is simple: money. A three-to-four-week spell spent writing a 25,000-word Animal Ark manuscript can net the author over £20,000 in royalties and foreign rights. 

The name Lucy Daniels was chosen extremely carefully. In addition to Animal Ark, there are now Animal Ark Pets, the stories of some of the original animals when they were small, Animal Ark Hauntings, ghost stories with positive messages, Little Animal Ark, for younger readers, Perfect Ponies and Nine Lives. The possibilities are literally endless because for every new idea there will always be an author out there somewhere. 

Enid Blyton tends to be sneered at by almost everyone these days, but in more honest moments every publisher would sell his or her soul to have a non-stop production line of best-selling titles. The only difference between Daniels and Blyton is that one is real and one is not.

He followed it with a second novel, Wonder Boys (1995), and two short-story collections. In 2000, Chabon published The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, a novel that John Leonard, in a 2007 review of a later novel, called Chabon's magnum opus. It received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001.

His novel The Yiddish Policemen's Union, an alternate history mystery novel, was published in 2007 and won the Hugo, Sidewise, Nebula and Ignotus awards; his serialized novel Gentlemen of the Road appeared in book form in the fall of that same year. Chabon's most recent novel, Telegraph Avenue, published in 2012 and billed as ""a twenty-first century Middlemarch,"" concerns the tangled lives of two families in the Bay Area of San Francisco in the year 2004.

Buckley', 'Buckley William F.', 'Jr., William F Buckley', 'Jr. Buckley William F.']",,/type/text,"William Frank Buckley, Jr. was an American conservative author and commentator. He founded the political magazine National Review in 1955, hosted 1,429 episodes of the television show Firing Line from 1966 until 1999, and was a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist. His writing style was famed for its erudition, wit, and use of uncommon words.

George H. Nash, a historian of the modern American conservative movement, believed that Buckley was ""arguably the most important public intellectual in the United States in the past half century"". ""For an entire generation he was the preeminent voice of American conservatism and its first great ecumenical figure."" Buckley's primary change to politics was the fusion of traditional American political conservatism with laissez-faire economic theory and anti-communism, laying the groundwork for the modern American conservatism of U.S. presidential candidates Barry Goldwater and President Ronald Reagan.

Buckley wrote first *God and Man at Yale* (1951); among over fifty further books on writing, speaking, history, politics and sailing, were a series of novels featuring CIA agent Blackford Oakes. Buckley referred to himself as either a libertarian or conservative. He resided in New York City and Stamford, Connecticut. He was a practicing Roman Catholic, regularly attending the traditional Latin Mass in Connecticut.

Chekhov is known as a very productive Russian playwright and author of many short stories.

**Biography**
Anton P. Chekhov was born in 1860 in Taganrog in Southern Russia.

In 1876, the father - a shop owner, son of a former serf  - was declared bankrupt, and the family moved to Moscow, leaving the young Chekhov in Taganrog, where he supported himself giving private lessons and writing for the paper. He joined the family in 1879 and entered Moscow University to study medicine, continuing his writing to support the family.

Though finishing his medical education in 1884, he only worked as a physician for a short time before he was hired by the newspaper *Novoe Vremya*, where he made his living. In the time that followed, Checkhov became well known in the literary circles of Moscow.

In 1887, he travelled to Ukraine to recover from illness, which inspired him to write several well-known works.

In 1890, Chekhov took a longer trip to Sakhalin, where he spent some time in the penal colony. This period had a great personal influence, and he published a work more in the genre of social science in 1893 & 1894 about his thoughts and experiences in Sakhalin.

In 1892, Chekhov bought an estate at Melikhovo, where he went into organising relief for famine and disease for the peasants, and he offered medical assistance, though he himself suffered from tuberculosis. Many of Chekhov's playes and stories feature the character of the country doctor, and he wrote several of his more famous plays while at Melikhovo.

As his illness progressed, he was sent to a clinic, and in 1898 he bought land in Yalta on the Crimea to have a place for his recovery. Impatient with living in the country, he continued writing plays for the Moscow Art Theatre.

In 1901, he married Olga Knipper, who was an actress working with Constantin Stanislavsky at the Moscow Art Theatre. She continued working there while he stayed in Yalta.

He passed away in 1904.

*Dates added - 01.29.1860-06.15.1904 - are of the [new style][1], but Russia didn't adopt that until 1918, so one will often encounter the dates 01.17.1860-07.02.1904.*

0,"['Mildred Grieveson', 'Caroline Fleming', 'Cardine Fleming', 'Anne Mather']",,/type/text,"Mildred Grieveson was born on 10 October 1946 in England. She had written all through her infant and junior years and on into her teens, the stories changing from children's adventures to torrid gypsy passions. Her mother used to gather these up from time to time, when her bedroom became too untidy, and dispose of them! 

Mildred has always wanted to write - which is not to say she has always wanted to be a professional writer. One the contrary, for years She wrote only for her own pleasure, and it wasn't until her husband suggested that She ought to send one of her stories to a publisher that they put several publishers names into a hat and pulled one out. The trouble was, She never used to finish any of the stories, and Caroline, her first published book as Anne Mather, was the first book she'd actually completed. She was newly married then, and her daughter was just a baby, and it was quite a job juggling her household chores and scribbling away in exercise books every chance She got. Not very professional, as you can see, but that's the way it was. The rest as they say in history. And now, more than 160 books later, She's literally - excuse the pun - staggered by what happened. She also published books as Caroline Fleming or Cardine Fleming. Her Anne Mather's novel, Leopard in the Snow, was developed into a 1978 movie. 

Mildred now has two grown-up children, a son and daughter, and two adorable grandchildren, Abigail and Ben.",10 October 1946,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,Mildred Grieveson,/authors/OL664803A,/type/datetime,2011-10-14T21:56:11.623663,7.0,,"England, U.K.",,Anne Mather,Mildred Grieveson,,[3373622],7,,,,/type/author,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Mather,1946-10-10 00:00:00,,71.0

Although his exact date of birth is uncertain, Asimov himself celebrated it on January 2.  His family emigrated to Brooklyn, New York and opened a candy store when he was three years old.  He taught himself to read at the age of five. He began reading the science fiction pulp magazines that his family's store carried. Around the age of eleven, he began to write his own stories, and by age nineteen, he was selling them to the science fiction magazines. He graduated from Columbia University in 1939. He married Gertrude Blugerman in 1942.  During World War II he worked as a civilian at the Philadelphia Navy Yard's Naval Air Experimental Station.  After the war, he returned to Columbia University and earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1948.  He then joined the faculty of the Boston University School of Medicine until 1958, when he became a full-time writer. His first novel, Pebble in the Sky, was published in 1950. He and his wife divorced in 1973, and he married Janet O. Jeppson the same year.

He's charming and English and lives in a white penthouse with a view of St Paul’s Cathedral, and you'd think butter wouldn't melt in his mouth until you read his dark urban fiction — 17 novels and over 120 short stories so far.
 His œuvre divides into black comedy, horror, mystery, the odd revolting death and a set of novels unclassifiable enough to have publishers tearing their hair out. Emerging from a film industry background, he has come painfully close to having movies made of his novels Roofworld, Spanky, Psychoville and Calabash, but oddly it was his short story “The Master Builder” that became a film called Through the Eyes of a Killer, starring Tippi Hedren and Marg Helgenberger. 
 He is currently writing the ‘Bryant & May’ mysteries, featuring two elderly, argumentative detectives, but his latest book, Paperboy is autobiographical. His graphic novel for DC Comics was the critically acclaimed Menz Insana.

Her first short story was published when she was sixteen and she's been writing and publishing ever since. Nowadays she earns her living from writing, something her well-meaning teachers and guidance counsellors warned her she would never achieve in New Zealand. Her short stories have appeared in many magazines and anthologies, and a collection of them was presented in Crossing the Bar, published by David Ling, where they garnered wide praise. 

In 1976, Daphne's first full-length romantic novel was published by Mills & Boon as Return to Love. Since then she has produced a steady output of romance set in New Zealand, occasionally Australia or on imaginary Pacific islands. As Laurey Bright she also writes for Silhouette Books. Her romances often appear on American stores' romance best-seller lists and she has been a Rita contest finalist, as well as winning and being placed in several other romance writing contests. Her other writing includes non-fiction, poetry and long historical fiction, She also is an active defender of the ideology of Feminists for Life, and she has written articles about it. 

Since then she has won other literary prizes both in her native New Zealand and other countries. These include the prestigious Katherine Mansfield Short Story Award, with Dying Light, a story about Alzheimer's Disease, which was filmed by Robyn Murphy Productions and shown at film festivals in several countries. (Starring Sara McLeod, Sam's wife in Lord of the Rings). 

Daphne is often asked to tutor courses in creative writing, and with Robyn Donald she teachs romance writing weekend courses in her home in the ""winterless north"" of in New Zealand. Daphne lives with her Netherlands-born husband in a farmlet, grazing livestock, growing their own fruit and vegetables and making their large home available to other writers as a centre for writers' workshops and retreats. Their five children, one of them an orphan from Hong Kong, have left home but drift back at irregular intervals. She enjoys cooking special meals but her cake-making is limited to three never-fail recipes. Her children maintain they have no memory of her baking for them except on birthdays, when she would produce, on request, cakes shaped into trains, clowns, fairytale houses and, once, even a windmill, in deference to their Dutch heritage from their father. 

Daphne frequently makes and breaks resolutions to indulge in some hearty outdoor activity, and loves to sniff strong black coffee but never drinks it. After a day at her desk she will happily watch re-runs of favourite TV shows. Usually she goes to bed early with a book which may be anything from a paperback romance or suspense novel to history, sociology or literary theory.",1939,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL81447A,/type/datetime,2013-07-06T20:08:36.317109,5.0,,,,Daphne Clair,Daphne Clair,,[7259066],5,,,,/type/author,,,1939-04-05 00:00:00,,78.0

He was educated in London, and for a time he studied medicine. After a World War I stint in the infantry, however, he decided to be a poet. This was a shortlived pursuit and he soon turned to biography and fiction. He then wrote many best-selling novels—African Queen and The General among them—before he wrote the first of his Hornblower stories in 1937. That first book was Beat to Quarters, chronologically the fifth volume in tracing the career of Hornblower. In 1940 Forester moved to Berkeley, California, where he lived for many years between his World War II and postwar travels. In April of 1966, while writing Hornblower and the Crisis, C. S.

One account says the location of his birth was the Château de Miromesnil, in Dieppe, though this is not certain. His paternal ancestors were of the minor aristocracy, and his maternal grandfather, Paul Le Poittevin, was Gustave Flaubert's godfather. His parents separated when he was 11 years old. 

Maupassant was gifted with a photographic memory, which aided him in recollecting events and characters for his stories. As a teenager, Maupassant was shown, by the poet Algernon Swinburne (1837-1909), a mummified hand. He used this haunting image in his early short story La Main Ecorchée (1875). In 1869 Maupassant started to study law in Paris, but soon, at age 20, he volunteered to serve in the army during Franco-Prussian War. After his return to Paris, Maupassant joined the literary circle of Gustave Flaubert, who introduced him to some of the leading writers of his day, including Emile Zola, Ivan Turgenev, and Henry James. Flaubert saw Maupassant regularly and schooled him in the craft of being a writer. 

From 1872 to 1880, Maupassant worked as a civil servant, first at the ministry of maritime affairs, then at the ministry of education. Toward the end of this time, Maupassant published his first poetry, Des Vers (1880). Later the same year he published his short story masterpiece, ""Boule de Suif"" (Ball of Fat) in the anthology Soirées de Medan (1880), edited by Emile Zola. The story, set during the Franco-Prussian War, is about passengers on a coach, one of whom is a well-known prostitute, nicknamed 'Boule de Suif.' The story later inspired director John Ford's Western film Stagecoach (1945). 

During the 1880s Maupassant created some 300 short stories, six novels, three travel books, and one volume of verse. In tone, his tales were marked by precision of style and a range of expression. Although his stories range from moving drama to sometimes bizarre comedy, it is his macabre horror stories that have received much attention. 

Among Maupassant's best known books is Une Vie (A Woman's Life, 1883), about the frustrating existence of a Norman wife, Bel-Ami (1885), which depicts an unscrupulous journalist. Pierre et Jean (1888) was a psychological study of two brothers. The novel was thought to be immoral, according to the classic definition, because the hero succeeds by doing wrong. Maupassant's most upsetting horror story, ""Le Horla"" (1887) (not to be confused with another of Maupassant's stories called ""The Trip of Le Horla"", which is about a hot air balloon), was about vampire-like ghouls, madness and suicide. 

Maupassant had suffered from syphilis since his 20's, which caused him neurological and mental problem in his later years, and which undoubtedly accounts for his shortened lifespan. Some critics have alleged that Maupassant's developing illness can be seen through a growing preocuppation with mental illness in his stories. However, the theme of mental illness is present even in his first collection, La Maison Tellier (1881), published at the height of his health. Maupassant's horror fiction consists of some 39 stories, only a tenth of his total work. A recurring theme in these is madness: ""A Queer Night in Paris"" is a paranoid nightmare: its narrator feels compelled to walk the streets. In ""Who Knows?"" the subject suffers from delusions about the furniture in his house. ""Diary of a Madman"" is a story about a judge, who commits murder, just for the experience, and condemns an innocent man to death for the crime. ""The Inn"" has many similarities with Stephen King's novel The Shining. His story, ""The Hand,"" based on his teenage recollection, has inspired later authors and movie directors. Maupassant's writing is sometimes compared with that of Edgar Allen Poe. 

On January 2, 1892, Maupassant tried to commit suicide by cutting his throat and was committed to the celebrated private asylum of Dr. Esprit Blanche at Passy, in Paris, where he died next year. Maupassant's style has been imitated by countless writers, and his influence can be seen on such masters of the short story as W. Somerset Maugham and O. Henry.

Sweet Valley High was the backbone of the collection, and was made into a popular television series. There were also several spin-offs, including The Unicorn Club, Sweet Valley University, and Sweet Valley Sorority.<p></p>

Francine Rubin graduated from New York University in 1958. It was there that she first met author and journalist [John Pascal][1] and, in 1965, they were married (the second marriage for each). Francine often credited John as her writing mentor, and they collaborated on several projects, including writing scripts for the ABC soap opera *The Young Marrieds*, which aired from 1964 - 1966. John died of cancer in 1981, at 49 years old.<p></p>

Francine's brother was the prolific Broadway playwright and librettist [Michael Stewart][2], who wrote the books to such Broadway musical hits as *Bye Bye Birdie*, *Hello, Dolly!*, and *42nd Street*. Francine, her husband John, and her brother Michael worked together writing the book to the Broadway musical *George M!*, which ran at the Palace Theatre from 1968 - 1970. A television version of *George M!* was aired on NBC in 1970.<p></p>

Michael Stewart died in 1987. Since then, Francine has revised his musical *Mack & Mabel*. She has also worked on the revision of another of his musicals, *Carnival!*, for the Kennedy Center in Washington.<p></p>

Francine's first young adult novel, published in 1977, was called *Hangin' Out with Cici*, in which her heroine, Victoria Martin, went back in time and met her mother as a teenager. It was televised as an ABC After-School Special entitled *My Mother Was Never a Kid*. She has written two other Victoria Martin books: *My First Love and Other Disasters*, and *Love and Betrayal & Hold the Mayo*. Another of her early novels, *The Hand-Me-Down Kid*, was also made into an ABC After-School Special.<p></p>

More recent works include the Caitlin series, a set of three trilogies which follows a teenage girl into adulthood, as well as a second mass-market project, the young adult fantasy spy series Fearless and its spin-off, Fearless: FBI. A TV series was also planned for Fearless, but for several reasons it never aired.<p></p>

*The Ruling Class*, a teen novel about a clique of spectacularly cruel girls who essentially run a high school in a wealthy Dallas suburb, was described in a Fantastic Fiction review as ""a magnetic tour de force created by a master storyteller at the top of her form.""<p></p>

In addition to her work for mostly female teens, Francine has written some adult fiction books, including *La Villa* (originally published as *If Wishes Were Horses*) and *Save Johanna!*, as well as a non-fiction book, *The Strange Case of Patty Hearst*, which she wrote with her husband John. (Although *La Villa* was billed as fiction, it has been suggested that it may have been based in part upon true experiences of the author and her late husband. Without further corroboration, however, this can be considered no more than conjecture.)<p></p>

John and Francine Pascal lived in Manhattan with Francine's three daughters from her first marriage: Jamie, Laurie, and Susan. (John had a son from his first marriage, Matthew, who lived with his mother.) After John died, Francine and her daughters remained in Manhattan, and Francine has been quoted as saying that much of the inspiration for her young adult novels came from watching her own three daughters grow up.<p></p>

Sadly, in 2008, Francine's oldest daughter Jamie died after a two-year battle with liver disease.<p></p>

Francine Pascal now divides her time between homes in New York and the south of France. Since John died, she has never remarried.

Ovid was also the author of several smaller pieces, the Remedia Amoris, the Medicamina Faciei Femineae, and the Ibis, a long curse-poem. He also authored a lost tragedy, Medea. He is considered a master of the elegiac couplet, and is traditionally ranked alongside Virgil and Horace  as one of the three canonic poets of Latin literature. The scholar Quintilian  considered him the last of the canonical Latin love elegists.[1]  His poetry, much imitated during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, decisively influenced European art and literature  and remains as one of the most important sources of classical mythology.[2] ([Source][1].)

She began writing while she was in high school, and she was the editor of a literary page in the school's paper.  She also wrote her first novel, Ralestone Luck, which was published in 1938.  Her first published novel was The Prince Commands (1934).  She graduated from high school in 1930 and began studying teaching at Flora Stone Mather College of Western Reserve University.  In 1932 she dropped out early due to economic conditions and began working for the Cleveland Library System.  In 1934, she legally changed her name to Andre Alice Norton, the pen name she had adopted to increase her marketability since boys were the main audience for fantasy.  In 1941, she bought a bookstore called the Mystery House in Mount Rainier, Maryland, but the business failed and she returned to the Cleveland Public Library.  In 1950 she became a reader for the Gnome Press Co.  In 1958 she became a full-time author.  In 1966 she moved to Florida for health reasons, and then to Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  In 1977, she received the Gandalf Grand Master Award from the World Science Fiction Society, and in 1983 she received the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.  She died in March of 2005 of congestive heart failure.

She has been called the Grande Dame of Science Fiction and Fantasy.  Over the course of her career, she published over 300 published titles read by four generations.  Shortly after her death, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America created the Andre Norton Award for outstanding work of fantasy or science fiction for Young Adults.",17 February 1912,,/type/datetime,2012-03-23T07:23:23.075961,January 2009,17 March 2005,,Andre Alice Norton,/authors/OL7099704A,/type/datetime,2013-03-14T01:51:34.099557,2.0,,,,Andre Norton,Andre Norton,,[5542283],2,,,,/type/author,http://www.andre-norton.org/,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Norton,1912-02-17 00:00:00,2005-03-17 00:00:00,93.0

He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland, and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is also in English and a ""light"" Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these pieces, his political or civil commentary is often at its most blunt.

He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement and after his death became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism. A cultural icon in Scotland and among the Scottish Diaspora around the world, celebration of his life and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th and 20th centuries, and his influence has long been strong on Scottish literature. In 2009 he was voted by the Scottish public as being the Greatest Scot, through a vote run by Scottish television channel STV. ([Source][1])

0,"['Ernest, Hemingway', 'Hemingway, Ernest 1899-1961.']",,/type/text,"Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American writer and journalist. During his lifetime he wrote and had published seven novels; six collections of short stories; and two works of non-fiction. Since his death three novels, four collections of short stories, and three non-fiction autobiographical works have been published. Hemingway received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.

Hemingway was born and raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school he worked as a reporter but within months he left for the Italian front to be an ambulance driver in World War I. He was seriously injured and returned home within the year. He married his first wife Hadley Richardson in 1922 and moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent. During this time Hemingway met, and was influenced by, writers and artists of the 1920s expatriate community known as the ""Lost Generation"". In 1924 Hemingway wrote his first novel, The Sun Also Rises.

In the late 1920s, Hemingway divorced Hadley, married his second wife Pauline Pfeiffer, and moved to Key West, Florida. In 1937 Hemingway went to Spain as a war correspondent to cover the Spanish Civil War. After the war he divorced Pauline, married his third wife Martha Gellhorn, wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls, and moved to Cuba. Hemingway covered World War II in Europe and he was present at Operation Overlord. Later he was in Paris during the liberation of Paris. After the war, he divorced again, married his fourth wife Mary Welsh Hemingway, and wrote Across the River and Into the Trees. Two years later, The Old Man and the Sea was published in 1952. Nine years later, after moving from Cuba to Idaho, he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.

Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid 1920s and the mid 1950s, though a number of unfinished works were published posthumously. Hemingway's distinctive writing style is characterized by economy and understatement, and had a significant influence on the development of twentieth-century fiction writing. His protagonists are typically stoical men who exhibit an ideal described as ""grace under pressure."" Many of his works are now considered classics of American literature. During his lifetime, Hemingway's popularity peaked after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea. [1]

For the past few years, despite a rigorous publishing schedule, I have spent as much time as I can out on the road, giving inspirational talks and fun workshops to children (and their parents) in schools, libraries and literary festivals, from Edinburgh, Cheltenham, even to Glastonbury.
I have worked in the UK, Italy and America, in a great diversity of settings, the more challenging the better!

The visits start with the simplest of readings, through explanations of the process of creating and producing a children's book, to drawing workshops and hands on pop-up workshops.
I am happy to work with all sizes of groups.
I have found working with children with special needs to be particularly rewarding.

I am a passionate advocate for the world of children's books and as the years pass, I have become more and more drawn to working with and empowering young children to expand their creativity through this magical world.

He served as an art director, editor, and writer of Army information publications in North Africa and Italy.

After the war, he worked in art departments at various magazines in New York City. In 1948, he married Patricia Murphy. In 1949, after submitting his portfolio to The Artists and Writers Guild, he signed a contract to produce books for their Little Golden Books line. His first book, Two Little Miners, was published that year. He continued to create Little Golden Books throughout the 1950s. In 1963, he published Richard Scarry's Best World Book Ever, which was very successful. In 1968 he and his wife moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, and in 1972 they purchased a chalet in Gstaad, where he worked most of the day in his studio.

0,,,/type/text,"Frances Hodgson Burnett was best known as an English playwright and author. Frances Eliza Hodgson was born on November 24, 1849, at Cheetham Hill, Manchester, England, to Eliza Boond and Edwin Hodgson. She was the middle child of five, with two older brothers and two younger sisters.

Frances grew up in a comfortable home. Mr. Hodgson sold brass goods to upper class households, and the family had a maid, a nurse-maid, and a horse and carriage.  However, in the early 1850's when Frances was only three or four years old, her father died of a stroke, and the family was forced to sell their house and move. Her mother carried on the business, and Frances was often left in the care of her grandmother, who taught her to read. Her future as a writer might have begun here.

When she was about sixteen, the family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee. From then until she was nineteen, Frances supported them by selling her stories to magazines.

In September 1873, she married Swan Burnett. The couple moved to Paris for two years and had there two sons. In 1892, following the death her son Lionel from tuberculosis, Frances suffered severe depression. In 1898, she divorced Swan Burnett and remarried two years later; this second marriage only lasted a year.

Frances settled in Long Island, New York, where she lived for the rest of her life. She died in 1924 and rests in Roslyn Cemetery in Greenvale, New York, next to her other son, Vivian.","November 24, 1849",,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,"October 29, 1924.",,,/authors/OL23767A,/type/datetime,2013-12-17T01:39:43.146428,10.0,"[{'type': {'key': '/type/link'}, 'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Hodgson_Burnett', 'title': 'Frances Hodgson Burnett Wikipedia Page'}]",,,Frances Hodgson Burnett,Frances Hodgson Burnett,,[6456748],10,,,,/type/author,,,1849-11-24 00:00:00,1924-10-29 00:00:00,75.0

He was educated at Washington and Lee (B.A., 1951) and Yale (Ph.D., American Studies, 1957) universities. In December 1956, he took a job as a reporter on the Springfield (Massachusetts) Union. This was the beginning of a ten-year newspaper career, most of it spent as a general assignment reporter. For six months in 1960 he served as The Washington Post's Latin American correspondent and won the Washington Newspaper Guild's foreign news prize for his coverage of Cuba.

In 1962 he became a reporter for the New York Herald-Tribune and, in addition, one of the two staff writers (Jimmy Breslin was the other) of New York magazine, which began as the Herald-Tribune's Sunday supplement. While still a daily reporter for the Herald-Tribune, he completed his first book, a collection of articles about the flamboyant Sixties written for New York and Esquire and published in 1965 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby. The book became a bestseller and established Wolfe as a leading figure in the literary experiments in nonfiction that became known as New Journalism.

In 1968 he published two bestsellers on the same day: The Pump House Gang, made up of more articles about life in the sixties, and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, a nonfiction story of the hippie era. In 1970 he published Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers, a highly controversial book about racial friction in the United States. The first section was a detailed account of a party Leonard Bernstein gave for the Black Panthers in his Park Avenue duplex, and the second portrayed the inner workings of the government's poverty program.

In 1979 Wolfe completed a book he had been at work on for more than six years, an account of the rocket airplane experiments of the post World War II era and the early space program focusing upon the psychology of the rocket pilots and the astronauts and the competition between them. The Right Stuff became a bestseller and won the American Book Award for nonfiction, the National Institute of Arts and Letters Harold Vursell Award for prose style, and the Columbia Journalism Award.

""The right stuff,"" ""radical chic,"" and ""the Me Decade"" (sometimes altered to ""the Me Generation"") all became popular phrases, but Wolfe seems proudest of ""good ol' boy,"" which he introduced to the written language in a 1964 article in Esquire about Junior Johnson, the North Carolina stock car racing driver, which was called ""The Last American Hero.""

0,"['Frederick R. Ewing, E. Waldo Hunter, Ellery Queen, Theodore Sturgeon, E. Hunter Waldo, Billy Watson']","Theodore Sturgeon was born Edward Hamilton Waldo in Staten Island, New York.  He changed his name in 1929, choosing Sturgeon to match his mother's surname after her second marriage, and ""Theodore"" to match his nickname, ""Teddy.""  His mother, Christine Hamilton Dicker Sturgeon, was a well-educated writer, watercolorist, and poet who published journalism, poetry and fiction under the pseudonym Felix Sturgeon.

As an adolescent, Sturgeon wanted to be a circus acrobat, but then had an episode of rheumatic fever.  From 1935 to 1938, he was a sailor in the merchant marine. He sold his first story in 1938, and his first science fiction story, ""Ether Breather"" was published in Astounding Science Fiction in 1939.  A few of his early pulp stories were published under the pseudonym ""E. Waldo Hunter.""  

He married his first wife, Dorothe Fillingame, in 1940.  That year, they moved to the West Indies, where Sturgeon managed a hotel for about a year.  He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, and in 1944 he returned to the U.S. and worked as an advertising copywriter.  He divorced in 1945, and married singer Mary Mair in 1949 until an annulment in 1951.  In 1950, he published his first novel, The Dreaming Jewels.  In 1951, he married Marion McGahan and they had a son in 1952, a daughters in 1954, a daughter in 1956, and a son in 1960.  In 1963, he ghost-wrote the Ellery Queen mystery novel The Player on the Other Side, which received critical praise.  He wrote two screenplays for the television show Star Trek in 1966 and 1967, and one screenplay for the show Land of the Lost in 1975, and two of his stories were adapted for The New Twilight Zone.

0,"['Barbara Schroeder Boswell', 'Barbara Boswell', 'Betsy Osborne']",,/type/text,"Barbara Schroeder was born on 28 October 1946 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, USA. She worked as nurse, before she married William P. Boswell, a attorney, and they had three daughters.

She has been a longtime romance novel fan, becoming hooked on the romances by Harlequin back in the mid-‘70s when she was home with her three small daughters. When the youngest reached school age in 1983, she wanted something to do with her extra time. She thought about going back to nursing, but didn't care to deal with hospital shifts. She'd often made up stories in her head and/or continued the stories that she'd read, so it seemed like a fun idea to try to write a story of her own. It took a lot more effort and organization than the loosely strung-together scenes she'd run through her mind, but she was right about the fun part! She enjoyed the whole process and wrote a story that she knew she would enjoy reading. She sent it off and was thrilled when it was accepted! It was even more exciting to see her name on the book cover. Some 50-plus books later, it's still a thrill to see her name on the book and it's still fun to make up stories — at least most of the time!

Barbara gets her ideas from everywhere but especially from reading, which she loves to do. Sometimes, just a sentence in a newspaper or a magazine will spark an idea to develop into a romance. Other times, she'll be inspired by another romance novel and she will try to put her own spin on a favorite old plot. Barbara believes that we all have our preferences — she's always been partial to the ""secret baby"" story line. That, plus the ""marriage of convenience"" and class or family conflicts are some of her particular favorites. 

Her three daughters are all grown up now, and she and her husband are the proud grandparents of a beautiful little grandson. They also have three cats who seem to think that they are the rulers of their house. They are terribly spoiled, and they just might be right.",28 October 1946,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL1474539A,/type/datetime,2012-06-03T18:12:45.261424,4.0,,,,Barbara Boswell,Barbara Boswell,,[7130488],4,,,,/type/author,,,1946-10-28 00:00:00,,71.0

He was a comic book writer, best known for his comic strip The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire. Aside from his writing, Butterworth was a gifted editor and created a number of new papers for the firm including Playhour Pictures (soon after abbreviated to Playhour), Valentine and the teenage girls' magazine Honey.

In 1965, he became one of the main script writers for Ranger where he penned the sprawling science-fantasy The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire. After he turned to freelance, his first novel 'The Soundless Scream' appeared in 1967 followed over the next few years by a number of well-received crime novels which appeared under his full name. Butterworth also turned his hand to Gothic romance novels under the pen-name Carola Salisbury. - Wikipedia","January 10, 1924",,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,"October 4, 1986",,,/authors/OL1086368A,/type/datetime,2016-06-20T15:14:19.230334,4.0,,,,Carola Salisbury,Carola Salisbury,,,4,,,,/type/author,,,1924-01-10 00:00:00,1986-10-04 00:00:00,62.0

Golding', 'Sir William Gerald Golding', 'William GOLDING']",,/type/text,"The winner of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Literature, William Golding is among the most popular and influential British authors to have emerged in the second half of the twentieth century. Golding's reputation rests primarily upon his first novel, Lord of the Flies (1954), which is consistently regarded as an effective and disturbing portrayal of the fragility of civilization. 

**Childhood and college years**
Golding was born in Saint Columb Minor in Cornwall, England, in 1911. His father, Alex, was a schoolmaster, while his mother, Mildred, was active in the Women's Suffrage Movement (the movement for women's right to vote). As a boy, his favorite authors included H. G. Wells (1866–1946), Jules Verne (1828–1905), and Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875–1950). Since the age of seven, Golding had been writing stories, and at the age of twelve he attempted to write a novel. 

Golding remained an enthusiastic writer and, upon entering Brasenose College of Oxford University, abandoned his plans to study science, preferring to read English literature. At twenty-two, a year before taking his degree in English, Golding saw his first literary work published—a poetry collection simply titled Poems.
 
After graduating from Oxford in 1935, Golding continued the family tradition by becoming a schoolmaster in Salisbury, Wiltshire. His teaching career was interrupted in 1940, however, with the outbreak of World War II (1939–45). Lieutenant Golding served five years in the British Royal Navy and saw active duty in the North Atlantic, commanding a rocket launching craft. 

**Lord of the Flies** 
Golding had enhanced his knowledge of Greek history and mythology by reading while at sea, and when he returned to his post at Bishop Wordsworth's School in 1945, he began furthering his writing career. He wrote three novels, all of which went unpublished. But his frustration would not last long, when, in 1954, Golding created The Lord of the Flies. The novel was rejected by twenty-one publishers before Faber & Faber accepted the forty-three-year-old schoolmaster's book. 

Initially, the tale of a group of schoolboys stranded on an island during their escape from war received mixed reviews and sold only modestly in its hardcover edition. But when the paperback edition was published in 1959, thus making the book more accessible to students, the novel began to sell briskly. Teachers, aware of the student interest and impressed by the strong theme and symbolism of the work, began assigning Lord of the Flies to their literature classes. As the novel's reputation grew, critics reacted by drawing scholarly reviews out of what was previously dismissed as just another adventure story. 

The author's extremely productive output—five novels in ten years—and the high quality of his work established him as one of the late twentieth-century's most distinguished writers. This view of Golding was cemented in 1965, when the author was named a Commander of the British Empire. 

**Later works**
After the success of Lord of the Flies, Golding enjoyed success with other novels, including Pincher Martin (1957), Free Fall (1959), and The Pyramid (1967). The author's creative output then dropped drastically. He produced no novels and only a handful of novellas (short novels), short stories, and other occasional pieces. 

In 1979 Golding returned with the publi cation of Darkness Visible which received mixed reviews. The author faced his harshest criticism to date with the publication of his 1984 novel The Paper Men, a drama about an aging, suc cessful novelist's conflicts with his pushy, over-bearing biographer. Departing briefly from fic tion, Golding wrote a book containing essays, reviews, and lectures. A Moving Target appeared in 1982, one year prior to the author's receipt of the Nobel Prize in Literature. 

William Golding died in England in 1993. A year after his death, The Double Tongue was released, published from a manu script Golding completed before he died.

García Márquez, affectionately known as ""Gabo"" throughout Latin America, is considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century. In 1982, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha; they have two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo.

He started as a journalist, and has written many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best-known for his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magical realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo, and most of them express the theme of solitude. [1]

Haasse volgde na een tweejarig verblijf (1920-1921) in Nederland de kleuterschool en katholieke lagere school in Soerabaja, Nederlands-Indië. In 1924 keerde ze terug naar Europa omdat haar moeder opgenomen werd in een sanatorium in Davos. Haasse woonde achtereenvolgens bij haar oma in Heemstede en in een kinderpension in Baarn. In 1928 keerde de familie terug naar Nederlands-Indië, waar Haasse haar middelbare school doorliep. Daarna verhuisde ze in 1938 naar Nederland om Scandinavische taal- en letterkunde te gaan studeren. In 1941 stopte Haasse met haar studie en begon ze met een opleiding aan de Amsterdamse Toneelschool. Op 18 februari 1944 trouwde ze met Jan van Lelyveld (1918-2008), die ze in 1939 had leren kennen bij Propria Cures, en beëindigde haar toneelcarrière. Wel bleef ze cabaretteksten schrijven, onder andere voor Wim Sonneveld. Haasse en Van Lelyveld kregen tussen 1944 en 1951 drie dochters. De oudste (Chrisje) overleed in 1947. In 1981 verhuisde Haasse met haar man naar Frankrijk.

Hella Haasse overleed na een kort ziekbed op donderdag 29 september 2011 op de leeftijd van 93 jaar.

0,"['Mann, Thomas, 1875-1955.']","Thomas Mann was a German novelist, short story writer, social critic, philanthropist, essayist, and 1929 Nobel Prize laureate, known for his series of highly symbolic and ironic epic novels and novellas, noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist and the intellectual. His analysis and critique of the European and German soul used modernized German and Biblical stories, as well as the ideas of Goethe, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer.

His older brother was the radical writer Heinrich Mann, and three of his six children, Erika Mann, Klaus Mann and Golo Mann, also became important German writers.

When Hitler came to power in 1933, the anti-fascist Mann fled to Switzerland. When World War II broke out in 1939, he emigrated to the United States, from where he returned to Switzerland in 1952. Thomas Mann is one of the most known exponents of the so called Exilliteratur. ([Source][1])

Her mother, Alberta Castle, raised her with her two brothers, Stephen and James. In 1970, she obtained a B.A in History at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and later she obtained a Masters degree in Library Science from San Jose State University, where she met Frank Krentz, an engineer. After her graduation, they married and moved to the Virgin Islands. She worked in the Duke University library system, where she began to write her first romance novels. The marriage moved to Seattle, Washington, where they continue living.

Now, Jayne Ann Castle Krentz with her seven pennames is considered a pillar in the contemporary romance genre. For some years, she only uses three pennames for each of three different periods from time: ""Jayne Ann Krentz"" (her married name) from the present, ""Jayne Castle"" (her birth name) from the future and her most famous penname: ""Amanda Quick"" from the past. She is famous for her work ethic, beginning her writing by 7 am six days a week. Her heroins never are damsels in hardships, they are often heroes. Her novels also contain mystery or paranormal elements.

Enthusiastic of the romantic genre, she has always defended its importance. To help educate the public about the romantic genre she became the editor and a contributor to Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of the Romance, a non-fiction essay collection that won the prestigious Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies. She established the Castle Humanities Fund at UCSC's University Library to allow the library to purchase additional books and has given money to 15 Seattle-area elementary schools to enhance their library budgets. She is also a member of the Advisory Board for the Writers Programs at the University of Washington extension program.",28 March 1948,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL25024A,/type/datetime,2013-03-17T21:15:11.930802,7.0,,,,Jayne Ann Krentz,Jayne Ann Krentz,,"[6457621, 7098798, 6457630, 6457625]",7,,,,/type/author,,,1948-03-28 00:00:00,,69.0

Along with Truman Capote, Joan Didion, Hunter S. Thompson, John McPhee, and Tom Wolfe, Mailer is considered an innovator of narrative nonfiction, a genre sometimes called New Journalism, which superimposes the essay onto the nonfiction novel. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize twice and the National Book Award once. In 1955, Mailer, together with Ed Fancher and Dan Wolf, first published The Village Voice, which began as an arts and politics oriented weekly newspaper distributed in Greenwich Village. In 2005, he won the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation.

0,,,/type/text,"Peter Straub was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on 2 March, 1943, the first of three sons of a salesman and a nurse. The salesman wanted him to become an athlete, the nurse thought he would do well as either a doctor or a Lutheran minister, but all he wanted to do was to learn to read.

When kindergarten turned out to be a stupefyingly banal disappointment devoted to cutting animal shapes out of heavy colored paper, he took matters into his own hands and taught himself to read by memorizing his comic books and reciting them over and over to other neighborhood children on the front steps until he could recognize the words. Therefore, when he finally got to first grade to find everyone else laboring over the imbecile adventures of Dick, Jane and Spot (“See Spot run. See, see, see,”), he ransacked the library in search of pirates, soldiers, detectives, spies, criminals, and other colorful souls, Soon he had earned a reputation as an ace storyteller, in demand around campfires and in back yards on summer evenings.

This career as the John Buchan to the first grade was interrupted by a collision between himself and an automobile which resulted in a classic near-death experience, many broken bones, surgical operations, a year out of school, a lengthy tenure in a wheelchair, and certain emotional quirks. Once back on his feet, he quickly acquired a severe stutter which plagued him into his twenties and now and then still puts in a nostalgic appearance, usually to the amusement of telephone operators and shop clerks. Because he had learned prematurely that the world was dangerous, he was jumpy, restless, hugely garrulous in spite of his stutter, physically uncomfortable and, at least until he began writing horror three decades later, prone to nightmares. Books took him out of himself, so he read even more than earlier, a youthful habit immeasurably valuable to any writer. And his storytelling, for in spite of everything he was still a sociable child with a lot of friends, took a turn toward the dark and the garish, toward the ghoulish and the violent. He found his first “effect” when he discovered that he could make this kind of thing funny.

As if scripted, the rest of life followed. He went on scholarship to Milwaukee Country Day School and was the darling of his English teachers. He discovered Thomas Wolfe and Jack Kerouac, patron saints of wounded and self-conscious adolescence, and also, blessedly, jazz music, which spoke of utterance beyond any constraint: passion and liberation in the form of speech on the far side of the verbal border. The alto saxophone player Paul Desmond, speaking in the voice of a witty and inspired angel, epitomized ideal expressiveness, Our boy still had no idea why inspired speech spoke best when it spoke in code, the simultaneous terror and ecstasy of his ancient trauma, as well as its lifelong (so far, anyhow) legacy of anger, being so deeply embedded in the self as to be imperceptible, Did he behave badly, now and then? Did he wish to shock, annoy, disturb, and provoke? Are you kidding? Did he also wish to excel, to keep panic and uncertainty at arm's length by good old main force effort? Make a guess. So here we have a pure but unsteady case of denial happily able to maintain itself through merciless effort. Booted along by invisible fears and horrors, this fellow was rewarded by wonderful grades and a vague sense of a mysterious but transcendent wholeness available through expression. He went to the University of Wisconsin and, after opening his eyes to the various joys of Henry James, William Carlos Williams, and the Texas blues-rocker Steve Miller, a great & joyous character who lived across the street, passed through essentially unchanged to emerge in 1965 with an honors degree in English, then an MA at Columbia a year later. He thought actual writing was probably beyond him even though actual writing was probably what he was best at - down crammed he many and many a book, stirred by","March 02, 1943",,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL32650A,/type/datetime,2012-12-22T00:38:07.095971,5.0,,,,Peter Straub,Peter Straub,,[6155683],5,,,,/type/author,,,1943-03-02 00:00:00,,74.0

0,,,/type/text,"Patrick Süskind is a German writer and screenwriter, best known for his internationally acclaimed novel Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, first published in 1985.

Süskind was born in Ambach am Starnberger See, near Munich in Germany. His father was writer and journalist Wilhelm Emanuel Süskind, who worked for the Süddeutsche Zeitung and is famous as the co-author of the well-known Aus dem Wörterbuch des Unmenschen (From the Dictionary of an Inhuman), a critical collection of essays on the language of the Nazi era. Patrick Süskind went to school in Holzhausen, a little Bavarian village. His mother worked as a sports trainer; his older brother Martin E. Süskind is also a journalist. 

Süskind studied Medieval and Modern History at the University of Munich and in Aix-en-Provence from 1968-1974, but never graduated. Financially supported by his parents, he moved to Paris where he wrote ""mainly short, unpublished fiction and longer screenplays which were not made into films."" In 1981, he had his breakthrough with the play Der Kontrabaß (The Double Bass), which was originally conceived as a radio play. In the 1984-85 theatrical season, the play was performed more than 500 times. Süskind was also successful as a screenwriter for the TV productions Monaco Franze (1983) and Kir Royal (1987), among others. For his screenplay of Rossini, directed by Helmut Dietl, he won the Screenplay Prize of the German Department for Culture in 1996. He rejected other awards, like the FAZ-Literaturpreis, the Tukan-Preis (de), and the Gutenbergpreis.

His best-known work is the internationally acclaimed bestseller Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (1985). This was made into a film in 2006 by Tom Tykwer. Perfume was on the bestselling list of the German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel for nine years. Süskind lives as a recluse in Munich, in Seeheim (Lake Starnberg), and in France. The public knows little about Süskind. He has withdrawn from the literary scene in Germany and never grants interviews or allows photos.

She considers herself a very lucky woman. The family didn’t have a lot of money, but she says that didn’t matter, because what they did have was worth more than money — a happy home. Her parents had a good marriage and they doted on their four daughters. That upbringing is reflected in the stories she writes. As readers all over the world have discovered, her books are filled with warmth and love of family.

Pat has lived in upstate New York, Northern Alabama, Southern California, and Stockholm (Sweden), and since 1969, in Houston, Texas with her husband. She says that no matter where she’s lived, she’s found that people everywhere are the same and want the same things: love and committed relationships. The marriage has three terrific grown children. They currently share their home with two longhaired cats, and a backyard filled with squirrels, birds, and other critters. Her hobbies and other interests include reading, walking for exercise, going to the movies and the theater, swimming, and traveling.

In 1990, Pat sold her first romance novel to Silhouette. Since then, more than four million copies of her novels have been published in eighteen different countries.

A few years later her mother died, and she moved to Chicago to live with her aunt. After graduating from high school, she began to write seriously, and began to sell her stories to newspapers and pulp magazines while supporting herself by working for The Chicago Public Library and bookstores in Chicago. She married her first husband in 1934. During the 1940s she was a children's book editor for both the Chicago Sun and the Philadelphia Enquirer. Her first book, a mystery for children called A Place for Ann, was published in 1941. Over the course of her career, she wrote more than 70 novels. In 1961, her book The Mystery of the Haunted Pool won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Juvenile novel, and she received another in 1964 for The Mystery of the Hidden Hand.

His books were published in 27 languages and sold more than 60 million copies worldwide. Each new book he wrote after he became an established writer sold more than one million copies.

West's works were often focused on international politics and the role of the Roman Catholic Church in international affairs. One of his best known works, The Shoes of the Fisherman (1963), described the election and career of a Slav as Pope, 15 years before the historic election of Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II. The sequel, The Clowns of God, described a successor Pope, who resigned the papacy to live in seclusion.

West was awarded the 1959 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for The Devil's Advocate. In the early 1960s, he helped found the Australian Society of Authors. He presented the 1986 Playford Lecture. In 1993, West announced that he had written his last book and a formal valedictory dinner was held in his honour. However, he found he could not retire as he had planned and wrote a further three novels and two non-fiction books. West died while working at his desk on the final chapters of his novel The Last Confession, about the trials and imprisonment of Giordano Bruno who was burned at the stake for heresy in 1600. - wikipedia",,,26 April 1916,,/type/datetime,2008-08-30T18:13:02.208561,,9 October 1999,,,/authors/OL4326566A,/type/datetime,2015-07-09T08:28:29.767476,7.0,,,,Morris West,Morris West,,"[7354859, 7354858]",7,,,,/type/author,,,1916-04-26 00:00:00,1999-10-09 00:00:00,83.0

0,,,/type/text,"Andrea Camilleri is an Italian writer. Originally from Sicily, Camilleri began studies at the Faculty of Literature in 1944, without concluding them, meanwhile publishing poems and short stories. From 1948 to 1950 Camilleri studied stage and film direction at the Silvio D'Amico Academy of Dramatic Arts and began to take on work as a director and screenwriter, directing especially plays by Pirandello and Beckett. Camilleri also worked on several TV productions, such as Inspector Maigret with Gino Cervi. In 1977 he returned to the Academy of Dramatic Arts, holding the chair of Film Direction and occupying it for 20 years. In 1978 Camilleri wrote his first novel Il Corso Delle Cose (""The Way Things Go""). This was followed by Un Filo di Fumo (""A Thread of Smoke"") in 1980. In 1992, after a long pause of 12 years, Camilleri once more took up novel-writing. A new book, La Stagione della Caccia (""The Hunting Season"") turned out to be a best-seller. Camilleri now lives in Rome where he works as a TV and theatre director. About 10 million copies of his novels have been sold to date and are becoming increasingly popular in the UK, Australia and North America. - wikipedia",6 September 1925,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL43288A,/type/datetime,2015-07-03T15:03:29.549324,6.0,,,,Andrea Camilleri,Andrea Camilleri,,[6692634],6,,,,/type/author,,,1925-09-06 00:00:00,,92.0

He is best known for his novels A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1864), From the Earth to the Moon (1865), Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1869–1870), Around the World in Eighty Days (1873) and The Mysterious Island (1875). Verne wrote about space, air, and underwater travel before navigable aircraft and practical submarines were invented, and before any means of space travel had been devised. Consequently he is often referred to as the ""Father of science fiction"", along with H. G. Wells. ([Source][1].)

0,,,/type/text,"Mary Lynn Baxter was born on 28 July 1943 in Lufkin, Texas, USA, where she bred, home of the cowboy - hero of the Western romance, which is one of the most popular of the category's sub-genres. She would be the first to say that it's her background that gives her a unique feel for romance writing.

Since she was a young girl, books and reading have been an important part of her life. Only after she read all the ""goodies"" in her public library did her mother encourage her to buy Harlequin romances, then 35 cents each. Wow! Those reading years laid the background for her decision to major in Library Science at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas, and become a school librarian.

After eight years of working in various school systems, she felt a need to do something different. What she wanted was to open a bookstore. With the help of her husband, Leonard, and her mother, Mary Lynn did just that. For over 20 years she sold books, and loved every minute of it. Then Mary Lynn decided she needed a new challenge. Following an intense amount of pushing and prodding from her husband she took the plunge and tried her hand at writing.

After months of agonising and chewing her nails, she finally mailed All our Tomorrows to Silhouette books in February 1981. One year later it was published as a Silhouette Special Edition. Now, over 40 books later, she's still writing. Mary Lynn can't think of anything else she'd rather do with her time and energy. She surfaces from her writing, she's a voracious reader. But this petite dynamo is always happy to tumble out of her world of fiction into her local fitness center for a bracing workout. She's also dedicated to her volunteer work... and still manages to fit in plenty of quality time with her family at their home in Lufkin, Texas.",28 July 1943,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL395646A,/type/datetime,2012-06-23T19:13:06.085679,6.0,,,,Mary Lynn Baxter,Mary Lynn Baxter,,[7117627],6,,,,/type/author,,,1943-07-28 00:00:00,,74.0

0,,,/type/text,"Margaret Ellis Millar (née Sturm) was an American-Canadian mystery and suspense writer.

Born in Kitchener, Ontario, she was educated at the Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate Institute and the University of Toronto. She moved to the United States after marrying Kenneth Millar (better known under the pen name Ross Macdonald). They resided for decades in the city of Santa Barbara, which was often used as a locale in her later novels under the pseudonyms of San Felice or Santa Felicia. The Millars had a daughter who died in 1970.

 In the early '60s, two of her novels (Beast in View and Rose's Last Summer) were adapted for the anthology TV series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller.

She was a master of character, a genius of plot twists, and a superb stylist. It’s rare to find those three talents in one literary package, yet, over the course of a 55-year-long career, Maggie maintained her high standards throughout her 27 books, short stories, half a dozen screenplays, poems, radio stories, and one touching memoir. Plus, she did it while struggling to raise a child, keep a house, and deal with a husband who later became more famous than she. Perhaps you’ve heard of Ken Millar. He wrote under the pseudonym of Ross Macdonald and created the Lew Archer detective series, which paid homage to the hard-boiled detective masters Dashiell Hammet and Raymond Chandler, and he eventually joined them in that genre’s pantheon of men.

Beaton', 'Sarah Chester']",,/type/text,"Marion Chesney was born in 1936 in Glasgow, Scotland. Her first job was a bookseller in charge of the fiction department in John Smith & Sons Ltd. While working there, the Scottish Daily Mail hired her to review variety shows; she quickly rose to be their theatre critic. She left Smith’s to work as a secretary--albeit without typing or shorthand skills--in the advertising department of Scottish Field magazine but was soon the fashion editor instead. She moved to the Scottish Daily Express, where she reported mostly on crime, then to Fleet Street and the Daily Express, where she was their chief woman reporter. 

Marion married Harry Scott Gibbons, and they had a son, Charles. Harry was offered a job as editor of the Long Island, New York, Oyster Bay Guardian, and the small family moved to the United States. The Oyster Bay job didn’t work out, and the trio moved to Virginia. Marion and Harry worked in the same greasy spoon in Alexandria--Marion waited tables, and Harry washed dishes. Happily, they both got jobs on Rupert Murdoch’s new tabloid, The Star, and returned to New York.

Marion wanted to spend more time at home with young Charles. In 1977, encouraged by her husband, she started to write historical romance novels, eventually publishing over one hundred books under her maiden name, Marion Chesney, and under a variety of pseudonyms: Ann Fairfax, Jennie Tremaine, Helen Crampton, Charlotte Ward, and Sarah Chester. 

By 1985, Marion was weary of historicals and turned to detectives stories, writing as M. C. Beaton. A course at a fishing school during a holiday in Sutherland provided inspiration for the first Constable Hamish Macbeth story. Eventually, the family returned to Scotland and and bought a croft house and croft in Sutherland, where Harry reared a flock of black sheep. Another move, to the Cotswolds, led to the birth of Agatha Raisin.",1936,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL20523A,/type/datetime,2014-05-04T03:48:03.063193,7.0,,,,M. C.

The family moved about a great deal when she was young. Her father always dreamed of retiring to Hawaii, and after he passed away in 1964 Johanna and her mother settled there to honor him.

In 1970, when she was still in school, she married Ralph Lindsey, becoming a young housewife. The marriage had three children; Alfred, Joseph and Garret, who already have made her a grandmother. After her husband's death, Johanna moved to Maine, New England, to stay near her family.

Johanna Lindsey wrote her first book, Captive Bride in 1977 ""on a whim"", and the book was a success. By 2006, with over 58 Million copies of her books have been sold worldwide, with translations appearing in 12 languages, Johanna Lindsey is one of the world's most popular authors of historical romance.

Johanna's books span the various eras of history, including books set in the Middle Ages, the American ""Old West"" and the popular Regency England-Scotland. She has even written a few sci-fi romances. By far the most popular among her books are the stories about the Malory-Anderson Family, a Regency England saga.",,,10 March 1952,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL23108A,/type/datetime,2016-03-13T07:34:04.029377,6.0,,,,Johanna Lindsey,Johanna Lindsey,,[6457639],6,,,,/type/author,,,1952-03-10 00:00:00,,65.0

After that, the family moved to Kansas, where she grew up, spending the summers in her grandparents' home in Alabama. She has two sisters, Mimi and Nancy, and two brothers, Thomas and Daniel. Her mother, Beverly, remarried with Verne, and she won a step-sister, Chrissy. Rebecca married very young with John Brandewyne, and they had a son, Shane, who was born, appropriately enough, on St. Valentine's Day.

Excellent student, she graduated *cum laude* with departmental honors from Wichita State University, earning a B.A. in journalism, minors in history and music, and an M.A. in communications. She obtained among several other distinguished instructors, three Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists, one of the foremost authorities in the field of interpersonal communication and two Victor Murdock Scholarship. Rebecca taught interpersonal communication at the University level before becoming a published writer.

She sold her first novel some months after her twenty-third birthday, making her, at that time, the youngest romance author in America, a record that stood for ten years before finally being broken. To date, Rebecca has written over thirty consecutive bestselling titles, including novels and novellas on the following lists: *New York Times, Publishers Weekly, USA Today, Los Angeles Times, Magazine & Bookseller*, Ingram, B. Dalton, and Waldenbooks, among many others.

She moved to England from 1961 to 1964, where she worked as a television actress and singer. She returned to Toronto briefly, performing as a singer and in cabaret revues until she emigrated to the United States in 1966.

In 1970, she married Walter Bateman Allen Jr and instaled in Connecticut in 1970. Shortly after her marriage, she began writing and sold her first novel, Love Life, in 1974. Prior to its publication, she had contracted to do a series of paperback originals for Warner Books, with the result that in 1976 three of her books appeared in print. Her award-winning autobiography, Daddy’s Girl , was actually the first book she wrote, but in 1971 it was deemed too controversial by the editors who read it. It wasn’t until 1980, after she’d gained success as a novelist, that the groundbreaking book was finally published.

Charlotte’s 30-plus novels have sold over eight-million copies, have been published in all English-speaking countries, in braille, and have been translated into more than 20 languages. She is consistently one of the most borrowed authors in worldwide English-language libraries. She also used the pseudonym of Katharine Marlowe.  In 2000, CBS bought the rights to Somebody’s Baby for a movie-of-the-week, and several of her other novels are currently under option for film and television.

In her writing, she tries to deal with issues confronting women, being informative while at the same time offering a measure of optimism. ""My strongest ability as a writer is to make women real, to take you inside their heads and let you know how they feel, and to make you care about them."" Her goal ""has always been to communicate, to enlighten people about women’s issues without being preachy, and to entertain while doing it. If I succeed in getting someone to think about the book’s content after they’ve finished reading it, then I’ve accomplished what I set out to do.""

A film buff and an amateur photographer, Charlotte enjoys foreign travel. She finds cooking and needlework therapeutic, and is a lifelong movie fan.

Gorky is considered the father of Soviet literature and the founder of the doctrine of socialist realism.

Instilled by his grandmother with a love of romantic tales and great sympathy for mankind, Gorky began a nomadic life at 12, wandering the Volga area. Since the czar's schools were closed to peasants, he educated himself, an experience he describes in My Universities (1923). He held dozens of menial jobs, publishing his first story in 1892. Gorky then became a journalist and married a colleague on the Samarskaya Gazeta. His articles exposed local corruption and he soon lost his job.
 
In 1898 Gorky's collection Sketches and Stories was published by a radical press and the author was an immediate sensation. These romantic tales concern the vigor and nobility of the Russian peasants and workers. About 1900 he turned to writing novels of social realism. Of these, Mother (1906) had the greatest impact on Soviet literature. Describing the awakening of revolutionary feeling in an ill-treated peasant woman, it became the prototype of the revolutionary novel. At this time Gorky became close friends with Leo Tolstoy and Chekhov, about both of whom he later wrote superb Reminiscences (tr. 1946).
 
Gorky donated most of his income to the revolutionary movement. He was arrested frequently but treated carefully because of his tremendous popularity. The czar rescinded his election to the Academy of Sciences in 1902, whereupon Chekhov and Korolenko resigned in protest. Gorky wrote 15 plays, two of which, heavily censored, were enormously successful at the Moscow Art Theatre. One of them, The Lower Depths (1902), a study of the wretched lives of derelicts, remains a classic. His plays, at first modeled on Chekhov's, emphasized characterization over plot.
 
After the failure of the 1905 revolution, in which he took part, Gorky sought to raise funds for the movement abroad. Following an initial triumphant reception in the United States (1906), he was insulted and mistreated there because his traveling companion was a woman who was not his wife. Settling in Capri (1906-13), he set up a Bolshevik propaganda school before he returned to Russia in 1914.
 
Although philosophically at odds with Lenin, Gorky was able to extract from him aid for many intellectuals and artists in an era of intellectual restriction. Exhausted from his work as head of the State Publishing House and by bouts with tuberculosis, he sought rest abroad (1921) and returned in 1928. His final, unfinished work, often considered his masterpiece, is The Life of Klim Samgin (1927-36), a panoramic four-volume novel of Russian social conditions from 1880 to 1917. Gorky's death at 68 has been ascribed to assassination by poison, perpetrated according to one view by an anti-Soviet group.
 
Gorky's work was remarkable for its vitality and optimism. It revealed, within its devotion to realism, a strong poetic strain and an eternal passion for justice. By the example of his work and life and by his literary criticism Gorky exerted a profound influence on Soviet thought. Most of his works have been translated.

0,['William F. Gibson'],"William Ford Gibson is an American-Canadian writer who has been called the ""noir prophet"" of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. Gibson coined the term ""cyberspace"" in his short story ""Burning Chrome"" and later popularized the concept in his debut novel, *Neuromancer* (1984). In envisaging cyberspace, Gibson created an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s. He is also credited with predicting the rise of reality television and with establishing the conceptual foundations for the rapid growth of virtual environments such as video games and the Web.

0,"['Lydia Hitchcock', 'Melinda Wright', 'Penny Jordan', 'Annie Groves']",,/type/text,"Penelope ""Penny"" Jones was born on November 24, 1946 at about seven pounds in a nursing home in Preston, Lancashire, England. She was the first child of Anthony Winn Jones, an engineer, who died at 85, and his wife Margaret Louise Groves Jones. She has a brother, Anthony, and a sister, Prudence ""Pru"". 

She had been a keen reader from the childhood - her mother used to leave her in the children's section of their local library whilst she changed her father's library books. She was a storyteller long before she began to write romantic fiction. At the age of eight, she was creating serialised bedtime stories, featuring make-believe adventures, for her younger sister Prue, who was always the heroine. At eleven, she fell in love with Mills & Boon, and with their heroes. In those days the books could only be obtained via private lending libraries, and she quickly became a devoted fan, and was thrilled to bits when the books went on full sale, in shops and she could have them for keeps. 

Penny left grammar school in Rochdale with O-Levels in English Language, English Literature and Geography. She first discovered Mills & Boon books, via a girl she worked with. She married Steve Halsall, an accountant and a ""lovely man"", who smoked and drank too heavily, suffered oral cancer with bravery and dignity. Her late husband bought her out of his own money at a time when he could ill afford it the small electric typewriter on which she typed her first novels. Her husband died at the beginning of 21th century. 

She has earned a living as a writer since the 1970s when, as a shorthand typist, she entered a competition run by the Romantic Novelists' Association. Although she didn't win, Penny found an agent who was looking for a new Georgette Heyer. She published four regency novels as Caroline Courtney, before changing her nom de plume to Melinda Wright for threebair-hostess romps and then she wrote two thrillers as Lydia Hitchcock. Soon after that, Mills and Boon accepted her first novel for them, Falcon's Prey as Penny Jordan. However, for her present historical romance novels, she has adopted her mother's maiden-name to become Annie Groves. Almost 70m of her 167 Mills and Boon novels have been sold worldwide. 

Now Penny Halsall lives in a neo-Georgian house in Nantwich, Cheshire, with her Alsatian Sheba and cat Posh. She works from home, in her kitchen, surrounded by her pets, and welcomes interruptions from her friends and family.",1946-11-24,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,Penelope Jones Halsall,/authors/OL1122921A,/type/datetime,2010-08-17T13:02:25.616401,6.0,,"England, UK",,Caroline Courtney,Penelope Jones Halsall,,[3373117],6,,,,/type/author,,,1946-11-24 00:00:00,,71.0

In my mind, there's nothing sweeter in the world than the heady fragrance of orange blossoms on a sultry summer night.

As a little girl I spent hours on my bed, staring out the window, dreaming of far off places, fearless knights, and happy-ever-after endings. In my imagination I was never the geeky bookworm with the thick coke-bottle glasses, but a princess, a magical fairy, a Joan-of-Arc crusader.

My parents fed my imagination by taking our family to Europe for a year when I was thirteen. The year away changed me (I wasn't a geek for once!) and overseas I discovered a huge and wonderful world with different cultures and customs. I loved everything about Europe, but felt especially passionate about Italy and those gorgeous Italian men (no wonder my first very Presents hero was Italian).

I confess, after that incredible year in Europe, the travel bug bit, and bit hard. I spent much of my high school and college years abroad, studying in South Africa, Japan and Ireland. South Africa remains a country of my heart, the people, the land and politics complex and heart-wrenching.

After my years of traveling and studying I had to settle down and earn a living. With my Bachelors degree from UCLA in American Studies, a program that combines American literature and American history, I've worked in sales and marketing, as well as a director of a non-profit foundation. Later I earned my Masters in Writing from the University of San Francisco and taught jr. high and high school English.

I now live in Seattle and Hawaii with my three sons. I never mind a rainy day, either, because that's when I sit at my desk and write stories about far-away places, fascinating people, and most importantly of all, love. I like a story with a happy ending.

Dick explored sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states. In his later works, Dick's thematic focus strongly reflected his personal interest in metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life experiences and addressed the nature of drug abuse, paranoia and schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and VALIS.

He grew up in Vilna and later in Warsaw, Poland, with family. In 1925, his father abandoned his family and remarried, and Kacew moved with his mother to Nice, France. He studied law, first in Aix-en-Provence and later in Paris. In World War II he became a pilot in the French Air Force. When the Nazis invaded and occupied France, he fled to England, changed his name to Romain Gary, and served with the Free French Forces in Europe and North Africa and was highly decorated for his bravery in the war (Compagnon de la Libération, Légion d'Honneur).
After the war, he worked in the French diplomatic service and married his first wife, author and journalist Lesley Blanch. His first novel, ""Education européenne"" (A European Education), was published in 1945. In 1952, he became secretary of the French Delegation to the United Nations in New York, and later in London. In 1956, he became Consul General of France in Los Angeles. He divorced Lesley Blanch in 1961 and married American actress Jean Seberg in 1962. He wrote the screenplay for the film ""The Roots of Heaven"" in 1958 and went on to direct two films, ""Les oiseaux vont mourir au Pérou"" in 1968 and ""Kill!"" in 1971, which starred his ex-wife Seberg, whom he had divorced in 1970. In 1979 Seberg committed suicide, and Gary followed her in 1980.
Over the course of his career he had written more than 30 novels, and had become one of France's most popular and prolific writers.

When that didn’t work out, they went to Virginia and Marion worked as a waitress in a greasy spoon on the Jefferson Davies in Alexandria while Harry washed the dishes. Both then got jobs on Rupert Murdoch’s new tabloid, The Star, and moved to New York.

Anxious to spend more time at home with her small son, Marion, urged by her husband, started to write historical romances in 1977. After she had written over 100 of them under her maiden name, Marion Chesney, and under the pseudonyms: Ann Fairfax, Jennie Tremaine, Helen Crampton, Charlotte Ward, and Sarah Chester, she getting fed up with 1714 to 1910, she began to write detectives stories in 1985 under the pseudonym of M. C. Beaton. On a trip from the States to Sutherland on holiday, a course at a fishing school inspired the first Constable Hamish Macbeth story. They returned to Britain and bought a croft house and croft in Sutherland where Harry reared a flock of black sheep. But Charles was at school, in London so when he finished and both tired of the long commute to the north of Scotland, they moved to the Cotswolds where Agatha Raisin was created.",1936,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL22017A,/type/datetime,2013-07-28T13:33:44.022933,5.0,,,,Marion Chesney,Marion Chesney,,[7259759],5,,,,/type/author,,,1936-04-05 00:00:00,,81.0

He published humorous articles and illustrations in The Judge, The Saturday Evening Post, Life, Vanity Fair, and Liberty and supported himself and his wife through the Great Depression with commercial illustrations for General Electric, NBC, Standard Oil, and many other companies.  He also wrote and drew a short-lived comic strip called Hejji in 1935.  In 1937, returning from an ocean voyage to Europe, he wrote his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street.  When World War II began, he began to create political cartoons and became an editorial cartoonist for the left-wing New York City newspaper, PM.  His political cartoons were later published in Dr. Seuss Goes to War.  In 1942, he began producing propaganda posters for the Treasury Department and the War Production Board.  In 1943, he joined the Animation Department of the First Motion Picture Unit of the U.S. Army Air Forces, where he wrote propaganda and training films.

Pushkin pioneered the use of vernacular speech in his poems and plays, creating a style of storytelling—mixing drama, romance, and satire—associated with Russian literature ever since and greatly influencing later Russian writers. He also wrote historical fiction. His Marie: A Story of Russian Love provides insight into Russia during the reign of Catherine the Great.

Born in Moscow, Russia, Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo. Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals; in the early 1820s he clashed with the government, which sent him into exile in southern Russia. While under the strict surveillance of government censors and unable to travel or publish at will, he wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov, but could not publish it until years later. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was published serially from 1825 to 1832.

Pushkin and his wife Natalya Goncharova, whom he married in 1831, later became regulars of court society. In 1837, while falling into greater and greater debt amidst rumors that his wife had started conducting a scandalous affair, Pushkin challenged her alleged lover, Georges d'Anthès, to a duel. Pushkin was mortally wounded and died two days later.<sup>[1][1]</sup>

There has been debate about his authorship of Rhesus, largely on stylistic grounds and ignoring classical evidence that the play was his.[1]  Fragments, some substantial, of most of the other plays also survive. More of his plays have survived than those of Aeschylus  and Sophocles  together, because of the unique nature of the Euripidean manuscript tradition.  ([Source][1].)

0,,,/type/text,"Michael Bedard grew up in a busy household in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. His first experience with writing came in high school when a teacher introduced him to poets such as William Blake, John Keats, T. S. Eliot, and Emily Dickinson, and he soon determined to become a writer himself. Studying both English and philosophy at the University of Toronto, Bedard graduated in 1971 and took a job in a university library. He also married and started a family. While working as a pressman for a small print shop, he found a publisher for his first two original fairy tale collections for children, Woodsedge and Other Tales and Pipe and Pearls.

From the outset, Bedard followed a challenging path as a writer. In both his early collections he made few concessions to young readers in terms of language. Although some reviewers complained, this adult tone is a quality Bedard has maintained throughout his fiction.",1949,,,,,,,,/authors/OL242867A,/type/datetime,2010-04-12T12:32:30.671539,5.0,,"Toronto, Canada",,Michael Bedard,Michael Bedard,,[3369395],5,,,,/type/author,www.michaelbedard.typepad.com,,1949-04-05 00:00:00,,68.0

She married and worked as teacher during years.

Robyn owes her writing career to two illnesses. The first was a younger sister's flu. Her sister was living with her husband and her and spent most of that winter acquiring, suffering, and recovering from various infections. One day she croaked that she had read everything on Robyn's bookshelves, so would She please buy her something cheerful and sustaining. Robyn found three paperbacks one Mills & Boon Modern Romance novel and a couple of other romances. Robyn read them, too, of course, and so enjoyed them she spent the next couple of years hunting down more Mills & Boon books. This was much more difficult then than it is today, so she decided to write her own, and for the following busy 10 years she wrote and hoped that one day. She'd finish a manuscript good enough to send off. The second illness was her husband's, and it was bad a heart attack. He was so young it terrified them all. While he was recovering he suggested that Robyn finish the manuscript She was writing and send it off. It wasn't a perfect manuscript, but the doctor had said to humour him, so she finished it, edited it as best she could, and sent it off. Three months later, she was astounded to read a letter from the Mills & Boon saying that if she made a few revisions they would buy her novel Bride at Whangatapu. Published since 1977, Robyn left teaching to become a full-time writer after her first three books had been accepted.

Robyn sees her readers as intelligent women who insist on accurate backgrounds, so she spends time researching as well as writing. She sometimes thinks that writing is much like gardening. It's a similar process creating landscapes for the mind and emotions from the seeds of ideas and dreams and images. Both activities can also lead to moments of extreme delight, moments of total despair, and backache. Now Robyn is living in the Bay Islands. She continues writing, and also finds time for a very supportive husband, two adult children and their partners, a granddaughter and her mother, not to mention the member of the family that keeps her fit, a loud, cheerful, and ruthlessly determined ""almost"" Labrador dog.

0,,,/type/text,"Laurence van Cott Niven — known as Larry Niven — is an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is Ringworld (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series The Magic Goes Away, rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource.

Niven was born in Los Angeles. He briefly attended the California Institute of Technology and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics (with a minor in psychology) from Washburn University, Topeka, Kansas, in 1962. He did a year of graduate work in mathematics at the University of California at Los Angeles. On September 6, 1969, he married Marilyn Joyce ""Fuzzy Pink"" Wisowaty, a science fiction and Regency literature fan. He is an agnostic.

[Comment by Russell Hoban from The Guardian][1]:

> The main thing about HP Lovecraft is his too-muchness; he never uses three adjectives when five will do, but he writes words that haunt the memory: ""In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."" My recall of the multiplication table is shaky but those words disquiet me today as freshly as when I first read them.

> Where did dead Cthulhu come from? Why did he rise up from the murky depths of Lovecraft's mental ocean? I say it's because there is a need for him and the rest of the maestro's monsters. Why is there such an appetite, such a hunger for scary stories and films? I think there is a primal horror in us. From where? From the Big Bang when Something came out of Nothing? From the nothingness we must become at life's end? I don't know, but I know it's there and we like to dress it up with a bolt through its neck or a black rubber alien suit; or as Cthulhu. Get a load of this: ""A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings"", with elements of ""an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature"", ""but it was the general outline of the whole that made it most shockingly frightful"". Close your eyes and try to imagine this creature of non-Darwinian evolution. Just the look of this bozo is already a major horror, and we're not even into the story yet. While he's dead and dreaming in his house at R'lyeh (""Dun Foamin""?) his Cthulhuvibes are spreading worldwide and causing strange rites and observances here and there. Lovecraft is not everybody's mug of Ovaltine but I have always found him horribly cosy.

After graduating from university, moved to Saskatchewan, Canada, to teach high-school English, on a two-year teaching contract in 1967. She married her Canadian husband, Robert Balogh, and had three children, Jacqueline, Christopher and Sian. When she's not writing, she enjoys reading, music and knitting. She also enjoys watching tennis and curling.

Mary Balogh started writing in the evenings as a hobby. Her first book, a Regency love story, was published in 1985 as A Masked Deception under her married name.  In 1988, she retired from teaching after 20 years to pursue her dream to write full-time.

At the age of six, Julie had her tonsils removed and complications from the surgery resulted in a long period of recuperation. She fell hopelessly behind in school and never caught up. ""I was a slow, slow reader,"" Julie says. ""I hated it."" At the age of 11, her mother discovered her daughter's secret and promptly enrolled her in a summer remedial reading class at the local high school. ""When I got there the nuns immediately realized I wasn't even remedial. By chance, Sister Mary Elizabeth passed us in the hall and was drafted to tutor me."" They spent the summer together, and Julie came to know Sister Elizabeth as a friend and mentor. The patient teacher eventually unlocked the door to the world of reading. ""She taught me to love the written word. First, she introduced me to the Nancy Drew mysteries. One of her favorite authors was O. Henry, and he became one of mine, too. Of course, some of the vocabulary was beyond me so I had to look up a lot of words. I sat on a large dictionary -- got up, looked up a word, sat back down."" Julie jumped up and down like a jack-in-the-box all summer.

Julie married young with Gerry Garwood and they had three children: Gerry Jr., Bryan Michael and Elizabeth. She began her writing career when the youngest of her three children entered school. After the publication of two young adult books, she turned her talents to historical romance fiction. Her first romance novel, Gentle Warrior, was published by Pocket Books with her married name in 1985 -- there have been over 20 novels since then. Her name appears regularly on the bestseller lists of every major publication in the country, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and Publishers Weekly. The popularity of her books expands with each new publication, and she is now read and enjoyed in many languages around the world.

With tens of millions of books in print, Julie Garwood has clearly earned a position among America's favorite fiction writers. Her reputation as a masterful storyteller is solidly founded in her ability to deliver stories with appealing characters, powerful emotions, and surprising plot twists. Readers claim that it's the humor as well as the poignancy of her novels that keep them laughing, crying and thoroughly entertained. Julie attributes much of her success to growing up in a family of Irish heritage. ""The Irish are great storytellers who relish getting all the details and nuances of every situation. Add in the fact that I was the sixth of seven children. Early in life I learned that self-expression had to be forceful, imaginative and quick,"" says Julie.

Julie lives with her family in Leawood, Kansas. When her schedule allows time away from family and career, she devotes her efforts to promoting literacy, and especially enjoys sharing her love of reading with student groups.",1946,,/type/datetime,2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462,,,,,/authors/OL26230A,/type/datetime,2011-08-15T00:34:41.503226,7.0,,,,Julie Garwood,Julie Garwood,,[6457669],7,,,,/type/author,,,1946-04-05 00:00:00,,71.0
